Coatomer complex is required for budding from Golgi membranes, and is essential for the retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport of dilysine-tagged proteins. In mammals, the coatomer can only be recruited by membranes associated to ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), which are small GTP-binding proteins; the complex also influences the Golgi structural integrity, as well as the processing, activity, and endocytic recycling of LDL receptors (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.; FUNCTION: Xenin stimulates exocrine pancreatic secretion. It inhibits pentagastrin-stimulated secretion of acid, to induce exocrine pancreatic secretion and to affect small and large intestinal motility. In the gut, xenin interacts with the neurotensin receptor.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Cytoplasmic vesicle","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","ER-Golgi transport","Golgi apparatus","Hormone","Membrane","Methylation","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Protein transport","RNA editing","Reference proteome","Repeat","Secreted","Transport","WD repeat"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250}.

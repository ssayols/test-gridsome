Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner (By similarity). Positively regulates phosphorylated protein HSF1 nuclear export to the cytoplasm (PubMed:12917326). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P62261, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12917326}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Host-virus interaction","Isopeptide bond","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12917326}.

May regulate the participation of VAMP7 in membrane fusion events; in vitro inhibits VAMP7-mediated SNARE complex formation by trapping VAMP7 in a closed, fusogenically inactive conformation (PubMed:23104059). Involved in peripheral melanosomal distribution of TYRP1 in melanocytes; the function, which probably is implicating vesicle-trafficking, includes cooperation with Rab32, Rab38 and VAMP7 (By similarity). Involved in the regulation of neurite growth; the function seems to require its GEF activity, probably towards Rab21, and VAMP7 but not Rab32/38 (By similarity). Proposed to be involved in Golgi sorting of VAMP7 and transport of VAMP7 vesicles to the cell surface; the function seems to implicate kinesin heavy chain isoform 5 proteins, GOLGA4, RAB21 and MACF1 (PubMed:22705394). Required for the colocalization of VAMP7 and Rab21, probably on TGN sites (PubMed:19745841). Involved in GLUT1 endosome-to-plasma membrane trafficking; the function is dependent of association with VPS29 (PubMed:24856514). Regulates the proper trafficking of melanogenic enzymes TYR, TYRP1 and DCT/TYRP2 to melanosomes in melanocytes (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q3UMR0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23104059, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24856514, ECO:0000305|PubMed:16525121, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18477474, ECO:0000305|PubMed:22705394}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ANK repeat","Cell membrane","Cytoplasmic vesicle","Endosome","GTPase activation","Guanine-nucleotide releasing factor","Lysosome","Membrane","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Protein transport","Reference proteome","Repeat","Transport"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Early endosome {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16525121, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24856514}.

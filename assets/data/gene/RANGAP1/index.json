Converts cytoplasmic GTP-bound RAN to GDP-bound RAN, which is essential for RAN-mediated nuclear import and export (PubMed:8896452, PubMed:27160050). Mediates dissociation of cargo from nuclear export complexes containing XPO1, RAN and RANBP2 after nuclear export (PubMed:27160050). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16428860, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27160050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8146159, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8896452}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Centromere","Chromosome","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Direct protein sequencing","GTPase activation","Isopeptide bond","Kinetochore","Leucine-rich repeat","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Repeat","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15037602, ECO:0000305|PubMed:8146159}.

Detected at the nuclear envelope during interphase (PubMed:11854305, PubMed:15037602). Targeted to the nuclear pores after sumoylation (PubMed:11854305). During mitosis, associates with mitotic spindles, but is essentially not detected at the spindle poles (PubMed:11854305, PubMed:15037602). Association with kinetochores appears soon after nuclear envelope breakdown and persists until late anaphase (PubMed:11854305). Mitotic location also requires sumoylation (PubMed:11854305). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11854305, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15037602}.","domain":"","geneNames":["RANGAP1","KIAA1835","SD"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["aggresome [GO:0016235]","axon cytoplasm [GO:1904115]","condensed chromosome kinetochore [GO:0000777]","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytoplasmic periphery of the nuclear pore complex [GO:1990723]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","dendrite [GO:0030425]","intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]","mitotic spindle [GO:0072686]","nuclear envelope [GO:0005635]","nuclear membrane [GO:0031965]","nuclear pore [GO:0005643]","nuclear pore cytoplasmic filaments [GO:0044614]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["activation of GTPase activity [GO:0090630]","cellular response to vasopressin [GO:1904117]","negative regulation of protein export from nucleus [GO:0046826]","protein sumoylation [GO:0016925]","response to axon injury [GO:0048678]","signal transduction [GO:0007165]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["cadherin binding [GO:0045296]","GTPase activator activity [GO:0005096]","Ran GTPase binding [GO:0008536]","RNA binding [GO:0003723]","ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]"]}},"context":{}}

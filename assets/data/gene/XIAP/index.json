Acts as a direct caspase inhibitor. Directly bind to the active site pocket of CASP3 and CASP7 and obstructs substrate entry. Inactivates CASP9 by keeping it in a monomeric, inactive state. Acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase regulating NF-kappa-B signaling and the target proteins for its E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity include: RIPK1, CASP3, CASP7, CASP8, CASP9, MAP3K2/MEKK2, DIABLO/SMAC, AIFM1, CCS and BIRC5/survivin. Ubiquitinion of CCS leads to enhancement of its chaperone activity toward its physiologic target, SOD1, rather than proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitinion of MAP3K2/MEKK2 and AIFM1 does not lead to proteasomal degradation. Plays a role in copper homeostasis by ubiquitinationg COMMD1 and promoting its proteasomal degradation. Can also function as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase of the NEDD8 conjugation pathway, targeting effector caspases for neddylation and inactivation. Regulates the BMP signaling pathway and the SMAD and MAP3K7/TAK1 dependent pathways leading to NF-kappa-B and JNK activation. Acts as an important regulator of innate immune signaling via regulation of Nodlike receptors (NLRs). Protects cells from spontaneous formation of the ripoptosome, a large multi-protein complex that has the capability to kill cancer cells in a caspase-dependent and caspase-independent manner. Suppresses ripoptosome formation by ubiquitinating RIPK1 and CASP8. Acts as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling and ubiquitinates TLE1, TLE2, TLE3, TLE4 and AES. Ubiquitination of TLE3 results in inhibition of its interaction with TCF7L2/TCF4 thereby allowing efficient recruitment and binding of the transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin to TCF7L2/TCF4 that is required to initiate a Wnt-specific transcriptional program. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11447297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12121969, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14685266, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17560374, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17967870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19473982, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20154138, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21145488, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22103349, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22304967, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9230442}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Apoptosis","Cytoplasm","Isopeptide bond","Metal-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Protease inhibitor","Reference proteome","Repeat","S-nitrosylation","Thiol protease inhibitor","Transferase","Ubl conjugation","Ubl conjugation pathway","Wnt signaling pathway","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.

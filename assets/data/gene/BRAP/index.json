Also acts as a Ras responsive E3 ubiquitin ligase that, on activation of Ras, is modified by auto-polyubiquitination resulting in the release of inhibition of Raf/MEK complex formation. May also act as a cytoplasmic retention protein with a role in regulating nuclear transport. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14724641, ECO:0000303|PubMed:10777491}.","keywords":["Alternative splicing","Coiled coil","Cytoplasm","Metal-binding","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Transferase","Ubl conjugation pathway","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9497340}.","domain":"","geneNames":["BRAP","RNF52"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","nuclear membrane [GO:0031965]","ubiquitin ligase complex [GO:0000151]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["MAPK cascade [GO:0000165]","negative regulation of signal transduction [GO:0009968]","protein ubiquitination [GO:0016567]","Ras protein signal transduction [GO:0007265]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["identical protein binding [GO:0042802]","nuclear localization sequence binding [GO:0008139]","nucleic acid binding [GO:0003676]","ubiquitin protein ligase activity [GO:0061630]","ubiquitin-protein transferase activity [GO:0004842]","zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]"]}},"context":{}}

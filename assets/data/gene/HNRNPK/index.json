Binds tenaciously to poly(C) sequences. Likely to play a role in the nuclear metabolism of hnRNAs, particularly for pre-mRNAs that contain cytidine-rich sequences. Can also bind poly(C) single-stranded DNA. Plays an important role in p53/TP53 response to DNA damage, acting at the level of both transcription activation and repression. When sumoylated, acts as a transcriptional coactivator of p53/TP53, playing a role in p21/CDKN1A and 14-3-3 sigma/SFN induction (By similarity). As far as transcription repression is concerned, acts by interacting with long intergenic RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21), a non-coding RNA induced by p53/TP53. This interaction is necessary for the induction of apoptosis, but not cell cycle arrest. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16360036, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22825850}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Activator","Alternative splicing","Cell junction","Cell projection","Cytoplasm","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Glycoprotein","Host-virus interaction","Isopeptide bond","Mental retardation","Methylation","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Repeat","Repressor","Ribonucleoprotein","Spliceosome","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Ubl conjugation","mRNA processing","mRNA splicing"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1729596}.

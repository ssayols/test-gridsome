Deubiquitinates and prevents proteasomal degradation of RNF123 which in turn stimulates CDKN1B ubiquitin-dependent degradation thereby playing a role in cell proliferation. Involved in decreased protein synthesis in atrophying skeletal muscle. Modulates transcription of major myofibrillar proteins. Also involved in turnover of endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) substrates. Regulates the stability of BIRC2/c-IAP1 and BIRC3/c-IAP2 by preventing their ubiquitination. Required for cells to mount an appropriate response to hypoxia and rescues HIF1A from degradation in a non-catalytic manner. Plays an important role in 17 beta-estradiol (E2)-inhibited myogenesis. Decreases the levels of ubiquitinated proteins during skeletal muscle formation and acts to repress myogenesis. Exhibits a preference towards 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19465887, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21849505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22128162, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22689415}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Endoplasmic reticulum","Hydrolase","Membrane","Metal-binding","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Protease","Reference proteome","Repeat","Thiol protease","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix","Ubl conjugation pathway","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19465887}; Single-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19465887}.","domain":"DOMAIN 113..202;  /note=\"CS 1\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00547\"; DOMAIN 282..384;  /note=\"CS 2\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00547\"; DOMAIN 497..1214;  /note=\"USP\"","geneNames":["USP19","KIAA0891","ZMYND9"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]","endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]","integral component of membrane [GO:0016021]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["negative regulation of proteasomal protein catabolic process [GO:1901799]","negative regulation of skeletal muscle tissue development [GO:0048642]","positive regulation of cell cycle process [GO:0090068]","protein deubiquitination [GO:0016579]","protein stabilization [GO:0050821]","regulation of cellular response to hypoxia [GO:1900037]","regulation of ERAD pathway [GO:1904292]","regulation of protein stability [GO:0031647]","response to endoplasmic reticulum stress [GO:0034976]","ubiquitin-dependent ERAD pathway [GO:0030433]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["Hsp90 protein binding [GO:0051879]","Lys48-specific deubiquitinase activity [GO:1990380]","metal ion binding [GO:0046872]","thiol-dependent ubiquitin-specific protease activity [GO:0004843]","thiol-dependent ubiquitinyl hydrolase activity [GO:0036459]","ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]"]}},"context":{}}

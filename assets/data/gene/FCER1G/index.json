As a component of the high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor, mediates allergic inflammatory signaling in mast cells. As a constitutive component of interleukin-3 receptor complex, selectively mediates interleukin 4/IL4 production by basophils, priming T-cells toward effector T-helper 2 subset. Associates with pattern recognition receptors CLEC4D and CLEC4E to form a functional signaling complex in myeloid cells. Binding of mycobacterial trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate (TDM) to this receptor complex leads to phosphorylation of ITAM, triggering activation of SYK, CARD9 and NF-kappa-B, consequently driving maturation of antigen-presenting cells and shaping antigen-specific priming of T-cells toward effector T-helper 1 and T-helper 17 cell subtypes. May function cooperatively with other activating receptors. Functionally linked to integrin beta-2/ITGB2-mediated neutrophil activation. Also involved in integrin alpha-2/ITGA2-mediated platelet activation. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P20491}.","keywords":["Cell membrane","Disulfide bond","IgE-binding protein","Immunity","Innate immunity","Membrane","Phosphoprotein","Receptor","Reference proteome","Signal","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8611682}; Single-pass type I membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8611682}.","domain":"DOMAIN 54..82;  /note=\"ITAM\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00379\"","geneNames":["FCER1G"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cell surface [GO:0009986]","external side of plasma membrane [GO:0009897]","Fc-epsilon receptor I complex [GO:0032998]","ficolin-1-rich granule membrane [GO:0101003]","integral component of plasma membrane [GO:0005887]","plasma membrane [GO:0005886]","tertiary granule membrane [GO:0070821]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class I [GO:0042590]","antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class II [GO:0019886]","blood coagulation [GO:0007596]","cellular response to low-density lipoprotein particle stimulus [GO:0071404]","defense response to bacterium [GO:0042742]","Fc-epsilon receptor signaling pathway [GO:0038095]","Fc-gamma receptor signaling pathway [GO:0038094]","Fc receptor mediated stimulatory signaling pathway [GO:0002431]","immunoglobulin mediated immune response [GO:0016064]","innate immune response [GO:0045087]","integrin-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0007229]","interleukin-2 production [GO:0032623]","interleukin-3-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0038156]","leukocyte migration [GO:0050900]","mast cell activation [GO:0045576]","negative regulation of mast cell apoptotic process [GO:0033026]","neutrophil activation involved in immune response [GO:0002283]","neutrophil chemotaxis [GO:0030593]","neutrophil degranulation [GO:0043312]","osteoclast differentiation [GO:0030316]","phagocytosis, engulfment [GO:0006911]","platelet activation [GO:0030168]","positive regulation of interleukin-10 production [GO:0032733]","positive regulation of interleukin-4 production [GO:0032753]","positive regulation of interleukin-6 production [GO:0032755]","positive regulation of mast cell cytokine production [GO:0032765]","positive regulation of mast cell degranulation [GO:0043306]","positive regulation of phagocytosis [GO:0050766]","positive regulation of protein localization to cell surface [GO:2000010]","positive regulation of tumor necrosis factor production [GO:0032760]","positive regulation of type I hypersensitivity [GO:0001812]","positive regulation of type IIa hypersensitivity [GO:0001798]","positive regulation of type III hypersensitivity [GO:0001805]","protein localization to plasma membrane [GO:0072659]","receptor internalization [GO:0031623]","regulation of platelet activation [GO:0010543]","serotonin secretion by platelet [GO:0002554]","stimulatory C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway [GO:0002223]","T cell differentiation involved in immune response [GO:0002292]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["identical protein binding [GO:0042802]","IgE binding [GO:0019863]","IgE receptor activity [GO:0019767]","IgG binding [GO:0019864]"]}},"context":{}}

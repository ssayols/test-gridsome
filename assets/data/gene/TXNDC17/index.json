May participate in various redox reactions through the reversible oxidation of its active center dithiol to a disulfide and catalyze dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions. Modulates TNF-alpha signaling and NF-kappa-B activation. Has peroxidase activity and may contribute to the elimination of cellular hydrogen peroxide. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14607843, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14607844}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Disulfide bond","Redox-active center","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14607844}.","domain":"DOMAIN 41..123;  /note=\"Thioredoxin\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255\"","geneNames":["TXNDC17","TXNL5"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0033209]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["peroxidase activity [GO:0004601]","protein-disulfide reductase activity [GO:0047134]"]}},"context":{}}

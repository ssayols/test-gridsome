Chaperone that regulates the assembly of spliceosomal U1, U2, U4 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome. Thereby, plays an important role in the splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs. Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP. In the cytosol, the Sm proteins SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm complex by the chaperone CLNS1A that controls the assembly of the core snRNP. Dissociation by the SMN complex of CLNS1A from the trapped Sm proteins and their transfer to an SMN-Sm complex triggers the assembly of core snRNPs and their transport to the nucleus. May also indirectly participate in cellular volume control by activation of a swelling-induced chloride conductance pathway. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10330151, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11713266, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18984161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21081503}.","keywords":["Acetylation","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Direct protein sequencing","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18984161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21081503}.

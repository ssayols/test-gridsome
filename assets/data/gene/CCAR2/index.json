Inhibits SIRT1 deacetylase activity leading to increasing levels of p53/TP53 acetylation and p53-mediated apoptosis (PubMed:18235501, PubMed:18235502, PubMed:23352644). Inhibits SUV39H1 methyltransferase activity (PubMed:19218236). Mediates ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by nuclear hormone receptors (PubMed:19131338). Plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and cellular integrity following UV-induced genotoxic stress (PubMed:23398316). Regulates the circadian expression of the core clock components NR1D1 and ARNTL/BMAL1 (PubMed:23398316). Enhances the transcriptional repressor activity of NR1D1 through stabilization of NR1D1 protein levels by preventing its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (PubMed:23398316). Represses the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function of ESR2 (PubMed:20074560). Acts as a regulator of PCK1 expression and gluconeogenesis by a mechanism that involves, at least in part, both NR1D1 and SIRT1 (PubMed:24415752). Negatively regulates the deacetylase activity of HDAC3 and can alter its subcellular localization (PubMed:21030595). Positively regulates the beta-catenin pathway (canonical Wnt signaling pathway) and is required for MCC-mediated repression of the beta-catenin pathway (PubMed:24824780). Represses ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function of NR1H2 and NR1H3 and inhibits the interaction of SIRT1 with NR1H3 (PubMed:25661920). Plays an important role in tumor suppression through p53/TP53 regulation; stabilizes p53/TP53 by affecting its interaction with ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (PubMed:25732823). Represses the transcriptional activator activity of BRCA1 (PubMed:20160719). Inhibits SIRT1 in a CHEK2 and PSEM3-dependent manner and inhibits the activity of CHEK2 in vitro (PubMed:25361978). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18235501, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18235502, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19131338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19218236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20074560, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20160719, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21030595, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22446626, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23352644, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23398316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24415752, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24824780, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25361978, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25661920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25732823}.","keywords":["Acetylation","Activator","Alternative splicing","Apoptosis","Biological rhythms","Cell cycle","Coiled coil","Cytoplasm","DNA damage","Isopeptide bond","Metalloenzyme inhibitor","Methylation","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Repressor","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Tumor suppressor","Ubl conjugation","Wnt signaling pathway","mRNA processing","mRNA splicing"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20074560, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20160719, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23352644, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24824780, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24962073, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25661920}.

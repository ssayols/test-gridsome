In addition to the cytosolic transport, selectively delivers specific fatty acids from the cytosol to the nucleus, wherein they activate nuclear receptors (PubMed:22170058, PubMed:21395585). Delivers retinoic acid to the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta; which promotes proliferation and survival. May also serve as a synaptic carrier of endocannabinoid at central synapses and thus controls retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. Modulates inflammation by regulating PTGES induction via NF-kappa-B activation, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) biosynthesis during inflammation (By similarity). May be involved in keratinocyte differentiation (PubMed:8092987). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q05816, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21395585, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22170058, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8092987}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Cell junction","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Disulfide bond","Lipid-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Secreted","Synapse","Transport"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24692551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8092987}.

Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Required for maximal ATPase activity of SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A and for association of the SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A containing remodeling complex BAF with chromatin/nuclear matrix. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and is required for the proliferation of neural progenitors. During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex which is involved in transcriptional activation of select genes principally by acetylation of nucleosomal histones H4 and H2A. This modification may both alter nucleosome - DNA interactions and promote interaction of the modified histones with other proteins which positively regulate transcription. This complex may be required for the activation of transcriptional programs associated with oncogene and proto-oncogene mediated growth induction, tumor suppressor mediated growth arrest and replicative senescence, apoptosis, and DNA repair. NuA4 may also play a direct role in DNA repair when recruited to sites of DNA damage. Putative core component of the chromatin remodeling INO80 complex which is involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA replication and probably DNA repair. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z2N8, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14966270, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29374058, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15196461, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22952240, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26601204}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Activator","Alternative splicing","Chromatin regulator","DNA damage","DNA recombination","DNA repair","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Growth regulation","Isopeptide bond","Mental retardation","Neurogenesis","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18026119}.","domain":"","geneNames":["ACTL6A","BAF53","BAF53A","INO80K"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["Ino80 complex [GO:0031011]","npBAF complex [GO:0071564]","NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex [GO:0035267]","nuclear chromatin [GO:0000790]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]","plasma membrane [GO:0005886]","protein-containing complex [GO:0032991]","SWI/SNF complex [GO:0016514]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling [GO:0043044]","blastocyst formation [GO:0001825]","chromatin remodeling [GO:0006338]","DNA recombination [GO:0006310]","DNA repair [GO:0006281]","histone H2A acetylation [GO:0043968]","histone H4 acetylation [GO:0043967]","nervous system development [GO:0007399]","neural retina development [GO:0003407]","protein deubiquitination [GO:0016579]","regulation of growth [GO:0040008]","regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0006357]","signal transduction [GO:0007165]","spinal cord development [GO:0021510]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["chromatin binding [GO:0003682]","transcription coactivator activity [GO:0003713]"]}},"context":{}}

Plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism as an activator of lipoprotein lipase. Both proapolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein C-II can activate lipoprotein lipase. In normolipidemic individuals, it is mainly distributed in the HDL, whereas in hypertriglyceridemic individuals, predominantly found in the VLDL and LDL. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:2209608, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22304839}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Chylomicron","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Glycoprotein","HDL","Hyperlipidemia","LDL","Lipid degradation","Lipid metabolism","Lipid transport","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Secreted","Sialic acid","Signal","Transport","VLDL"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted {ECO:0000269|PubMed:3525527}.","domain":"","geneNames":["APOC2","APC2"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["chylomicron [GO:0042627]","early endosome [GO:0005769]","extracellular region [GO:0005576]","extracellular space [GO:0005615]","intermediate-density lipoprotein particle [GO:0034363]","low-density lipoprotein particle [GO:0034362]","spherical high-density lipoprotein particle [GO:0034366]","very-low-density lipoprotein particle [GO:0034361]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cholesterol efflux [GO:0033344]","cholesterol homeostasis [GO:0042632]","chylomicron assembly [GO:0034378]","chylomicron remnant clearance [GO:0034382]","chylomicron remodeling [GO:0034371]","high-density lipoprotein particle clearance [GO:0034384]","high-density lipoprotein particle remodeling [GO:0034375]","lipid catabolic process [GO:0016042]","lipoprotein transport [GO:0042953]","negative regulation of cholesterol transport [GO:0032375]","negative regulation of lipid metabolic process [GO:0045833]","negative regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis [GO:0048261]","negative regulation of very-low-density lipoprotein particle clearance [GO:0010916]","phospholipid efflux [GO:0033700]","positive regulation of fatty acid biosynthetic process [GO:0045723]","positive regulation of lipoprotein lipase activity [GO:0051006]","positive regulation of phospholipase activity [GO:0010518]","positive regulation of phospholipid catabolic process [GO:0060697]","positive regulation of triglyceride catabolic process [GO:0010898]","positive regulation of very-low-density lipoprotein particle remodeling [GO:0010902]","response to drug [GO:0042493]","retinoid metabolic process [GO:0001523]","reverse cholesterol transport [GO:0043691]","triglyceride homeostasis [GO:0070328]","triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle remodeling [GO:0034370]","very-low-density lipoprotein particle remodeling [GO:0034372]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["lipase inhibitor activity [GO:0055102]","lipid binding [GO:0008289]","lipoprotein lipase activator activity [GO:0060230]","phospholipase activator activity [GO:0016004]","phospholipase binding [GO:0043274]"]}},"context":{}}

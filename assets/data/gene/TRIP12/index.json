Part of the ubiquitin fusion degradation (UFD) pathway, a process that mediates ubiquitination of protein at their N-terminus, regardless of the presence of lysine residues in target proteins (PubMed:19028681). Acts as a key regulator of DNA damage response by acting as a suppressor of RNF168, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that promotes accumulation of 'Lys-63'-linked histone H2A and H2AX at DNA damage sites, thereby acting as a guard against excessive spreading of ubiquitinated chromatin at damaged chromosomes (PubMed:22884692). In normal cells, mediates ubiquitination and degradation of isoform p19ARF/ARF of CDKN2A, a lysine-less tumor suppressor required for p53/TP53 activation under oncogenic stress (PubMed:20208519). In cancer cells, however, isoform p19ARF/ARF and TRIP12 are located in different cell compartments, preventing isoform p19ARF/ARF ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:20208519). Does not mediate ubiquitination of isoform p16-INK4a of CDKN2A (PubMed:20208519). Also catalyzes ubiquitination of NAE1 and SMARCE1, leading to their degradation (PubMed:18627766). Ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins is regulated by interaction with proteins such as MYC, TRADD or SMARCC1, which disrupt the interaction between TRIP12 and target proteins (PubMed:20829358). Mediates ubiquitination of ASXL1: following binding to N(6)-methyladenosine methylated DNA, ASXL1 is ubiquitinated by TRIP12, leading to its degradation and subsequent inactivation of the PR-DUB complex (PubMed:30982744). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18627766, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19028681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20208519, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20829358, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22884692, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30982744}.","keywords":["Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Autism spectrum disorder","DNA damage","DNA repair","Disease mutation","Mental retardation","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Transferase","Ubl conjugation pathway"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus, nucleoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20208519}.","domain":"DOMAIN 749..836;  /note=\"WWE\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00248\"; DOMAIN 1885..1992;  /note=\"HECT\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00104\"","geneNames":["TRIP12","KIAA0045","ULF"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]","nuclear speck [GO:0016607]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cellular response to DNA damage stimulus [GO:0006974]","DNA repair [GO:0006281]","negative regulation of double-strand break repair [GO:2000780]","negative regulation of histone H2A K63-linked ubiquitination [GO:1901315]","protein polyubiquitination [GO:0000209]","regulation of double-strand break repair [GO:2000779]","regulation of embryonic development [GO:0045995]","ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0006511]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["thyroid hormone receptor binding [GO:0046966]","ubiquitin protein ligase activity [GO:0061630]"]}},"context":{}}

Inhibits EP300 and CBP histone acetyltransferase activity. May be involved in coupling cell cycle exit to the transcriptional activation of genes required for cellular differentiation. May act as a candidate coinhibitory factor for NR0B2 that can be directly linked to transcription inhibitory mechanisms. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11073989, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11073990}.","keywords":["Alternative splicing","Cell cycle","Cytoplasm","Differentiation","Nucleus","Reference proteome","Repressor","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11223246}.

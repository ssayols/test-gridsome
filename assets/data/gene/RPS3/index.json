Has endonuclease activity and plays a role in repair of damaged DNA (PubMed:7775413). Cleaves phosphodiester bonds of DNAs containing altered bases with broad specificity and cleaves supercoiled DNA more efficiently than relaxed DNA (PubMed:15707971). Displays high binding affinity for 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a common DNA lesion caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (PubMed:14706345). Has also been shown to bind with similar affinity to intact and damaged DNA (PubMed:18610840). Stimulates the N-glycosylase activity of the base excision protein OGG1 (PubMed:15518571). Enhances the uracil excision activity of UNG1 (PubMed:18973764). Also stimulates the cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone by APEX1 (PubMed:18973764). When located in the mitochondrion, reduces cellular ROS levels and mitochondrial DNA damage (PubMed:23911537). Has also been shown to negatively regulate DNA repair in cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (PubMed:17049931). Plays a role in regulating transcription as part of the NF-kappa-B p65-p50 complex where it binds to the RELA/p65 subunit, enhances binding of the complex to DNA and promotes transcription of target genes (PubMed:18045535). Represses its own translation by binding to its cognate mRNA (PubMed:20217897). Binds to and protects TP53/p53 from MDM2-mediated ubiquitination (PubMed:19656744). Involved in spindle formation and chromosome movement during mitosis by regulating microtubule polymerization (PubMed:23131551). Involved in induction of apoptosis through its role in activation of CASP8 (PubMed:14988002). Induces neuronal apoptosis by interacting with the E2F1 transcription factor and acting synergistically with it to up-regulate pro-apoptotic proteins BCL2L11/BIM and HRK/Dp5 (PubMed:20605787). Interacts with TRADD following exposure to UV radiation and induces apoptosis by caspase-dependent JNK activation (PubMed:22510408). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14706345, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14988002, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15518571, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15707971, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17049931, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18045535, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18610840, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18973764, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19656744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20217897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20605787, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22510408, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23131551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23911537, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7775413, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8706699}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Apoptosis","Cell cycle","Cell division","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","DNA damage","DNA repair","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Isopeptide bond","Lyase","Membrane","Methylation","Mitochondrion","Mitochondrion inner membrane","Mitosis","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Ribonucleoprotein","Ribosomal protein","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Translation regulation","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314389, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17289661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17560175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18045535, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20217897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21871177}.

Note=In normal cells, located mainly in the cytoplasm with small amounts in the nucleus but translocates to the nucleus in cells undergoing apoptosis (By similarity). Nuclear translocation is induced by DNA damaging agents such as hydrogen peroxide (PubMed:17560175). Accumulates in the mitochondrion in response to increased ROS levels (PubMed:23911537). Localizes to the spindle during mitosis (PubMed:23131551).

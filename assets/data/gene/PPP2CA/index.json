PP2A can modulate the activity of phosphorylase B kinase casein kinase 2, mitogen-stimulated S6 kinase, and MAP-2 kinase. Cooperates with SGO2 to protect centromeric cohesin from separase-mediated cleavage in oocytes specifically during meiosis I (By similarity). Can dephosphorylate SV40 large T antigen and p53/TP53. Activates RAF1 by dephosphorylating it at 'Ser-259'. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10801873, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22613722, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9920888}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Centromere","Chromosome","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Hydrolase","Manganese","Meiosis","Mental retardation","Metal-binding","Methylation","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Protein phosphatase","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16541025}.

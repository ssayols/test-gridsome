Endosomal acidification leads to iron release. The apotransferrin-receptor complex is then recycled to the cell surface with a return to neutral pH and the concomitant loss of affinity of apotransferrin for its receptor. Transferrin receptor is necessary for development of erythrocytes and the nervous system (By similarity). A second ligand, the heditary hemochromatosis protein HFE, competes for binding with transferrin for an overlapping C-terminal binding site. Positively regulates T and B cell proliferation through iron uptake (PubMed:26642240). {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26642240, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3568132}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for new-world arenaviruses: Guanarito, Junin and Machupo virus. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17287727, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18268337}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Cell membrane","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Disulfide bond","Endocytosis","Glycoprotein","Host cell receptor for virus entry","Host-virus interaction","Lipoprotein","Membrane","Palmitate","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Receptor","Reference proteome","Secreted","Signal-anchor","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17081065}; Single-pass type II membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17081065}.

This type of polyubiquitination does not lead to protein degradation by the proteasome. Mediates transcriptional activation of target genes. Plays a role in the control of progress through the cell cycle and differentiation. Plays a role in the error-free DNA repair pathway and contributes to the survival of cells after DNA damage. Acts together with the E3 ligases, HLTF and SHPRH, in the 'Lys-63'-linked poly-ubiquitination of PCNA upon genotoxic stress, which is required for DNA repair. Appears to act together with E3 ligase RNF5 in the 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of JKAMP thereby regulating JKAMP function by decreasing its association with components of the proteasome and ERAD. Promotes TRIM5 capsid-specific restriction activity and the UBE2V1-UBE2N heterodimer acts in concert with TRIM5 to generate 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains which activate the MAP3K7/TAK1 complex which in turn results in the induction and expression of NF-kappa-B and MAPK-responsive inflammatory genes. Together with RNF135 and UB2V1, catalyzes the viral RNA-dependent 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I/DDX58 to activate the downstream signaling pathway that leads to interferon beta production (PubMed:28469175, PubMed:31006531). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10089880, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14562038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19269966, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20061386, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21512573, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28469175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31006531}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Acetylation","Cytoplasm","DNA damage","DNA repair","Direct protein sequencing","Disulfide bond","Isopeptide bond","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Reference proteome","Transferase","Ubl conjugation","Ubl conjugation pathway"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19340006}.

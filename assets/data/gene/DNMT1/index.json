Preferentially methylates hemimethylated DNA. Associates with DNA replication sites in S phase maintaining the methylation pattern in the newly synthesized strand, that is essential for epigenetic inheritance. Associates with chromatin during G2 and M phases to maintain DNA methylation independently of replication. It is responsible for maintaining methylation patterns established in development. DNA methylation is coordinated with methylation of histones. Mediates transcriptional repression by direct binding to HDAC2. In association with DNMT3B and via the recruitment of CTCFL/BORIS, involved in activation of BAG1 gene expression by modulating dimethylation of promoter histone H3 at H3K4 and H3K9. Probably forms a corepressor complex required for activated KRAS-mediated promoter hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) or other tumor-related genes in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (PubMed:24623306). Also required to maintain a transcriptionally repressive state of genes in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (PubMed:24623306). Associates at promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) leading to their gene silencing (PubMed:24623306). Promotes tumor growth (PubMed:24623306). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16357870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18413740, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18754681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24623306}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Activator","Alternative splicing","Chromatin regulator","DNA-binding","Deafness","Disease mutation","Isopeptide bond","Metal-binding","Methylation","Methyltransferase","Neuropathy","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Repeat","Repressor","S-adenosyl-L-methionine","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Transferase","Ubl conjugation","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12145218}.","domain":"DOMAIN 16..109;  /note=\"DMAP1-binding\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU01260\"; DOMAIN 755..880;  /note=\"BAH 1\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00370\"; DOMAIN 972..1100;  /note=\"BAH 2\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00370\"; DOMAIN 1139..1599;  /note=\"SAM-dependent MTase C5-type\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU01016\"","geneNames":["DNMT1","AIM","CXXC9","DNMT"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]","pericentric heterochromatin [GO:0005721]","replication fork [GO:0005657]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cellular response to amino acid stimulus [GO:0071230]","chromatin organization [GO:0006325]","DNA methylation [GO:0006306]","DNA methylation involved in embryo development [GO:0043045]","DNA methylation on cytosine within a CG sequence [GO:0010424]","gene silencing [GO:0016458]","maintenance of DNA methylation [GO:0010216]","negative regulation of gene expression [GO:0010629]","negative regulation of gene expression, epigenetic [GO:0045814]","negative regulation of histone H3-K9 methylation [GO:0051573]","negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]","negative regulation of vascular associated smooth muscle cell apoptotic process [GO:1905460]","negative regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation involved in phenotypic switching [GO:1905931]","positive regulation of gene expression [GO:0010628]","positive regulation of histone H3-K4 methylation [GO:0051571]","positive regulation of methylation-dependent chromatin silencing [GO:0090309]","positive regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [GO:1904707]","Ras protein signal transduction [GO:0007265]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase activity [GO:0003886]","DNA binding [GO:0003677]","DNA-methyltransferase activity [GO:0009008]","methyl-CpG binding [GO:0008327]","promoter-specific chromatin binding [GO:1990841]","RNA binding [GO:0003723]","zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]"]}},"context":{}}

May act by forming a channel that allows the retrotranslocation of misfolded glycoproteins into the cytosol where they are ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. May mediate the interaction between VCP and misfolded glycoproteins (PubMed:16186509, PubMed:16449189). May also be involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced pre-emptive quality control, a mechanism that selectively attenuates the translocation of newly synthesized proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum and reroutes them to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation (PubMed:26565908). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16186509, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16449189, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26565908}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) In contrast to DERL1, it is not involved in the degradation of MHC class I heavy chains following infection by cytomegaloviruses. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15215855}.","keywords":["Endoplasmic reticulum","Host-virus interaction","Membrane","Reference proteome","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix","Unfolded protein response"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15215855, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16449189}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15215855, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16449189}.","domain":"","geneNames":["DERL2","DER2","FLANA","CGI-101","SBBI53"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["early endosome [GO:0005769]","endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]","endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]","endoplasmic reticulum quality control compartment [GO:0044322]","Hrd1p ubiquitin ligase ERAD-L complex [GO:0000839]","integral component of endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0030176]","late endosome [GO:0005770]","membrane [GO:0016020]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["endoplasmic reticulum mannose trimming [GO:1904380]","endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response [GO:0030968]","negative regulation of retrograde protein transport, ER to cytosol [GO:1904153]","positive regulation of cell growth [GO:0030307]","positive regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008284]","retrograde protein transport, ER to cytosol [GO:0030970]","suckling behavior [GO:0001967]","ubiquitin-dependent ERAD pathway [GO:0030433]","viral process [GO:0016032]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["misfolded protein binding [GO:0051787]","ubiquitin-specific protease binding [GO:1990381]"]}},"context":{}}

Negatively regulates NF-kappa-B-mediated gene transcription through the control of RELA phosphorylation (PubMed:17785205, PubMed:20228063). Also regulates mitotic G2/M transition checkpoint and mitotic G2 DNA damage checkpoint (PubMed:15790566, PubMed:19223857). Through its interaction with CDKN2A/ARF and MDM2 may induce MDM2-dependent p53/TP53 ubiquitination, stabilization and activation in the nucleus, thereby promoting G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibition of cell proliferation (PubMed:16173922). May play a role in the unfolded protein response, mediating the ufmylation of multiple proteins in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (PubMed:23152784). May also play a role in the rupture of the nuclear envelope during apoptosis (PubMed:23478299). May regulate MAPK14 activity by regulating its dephosphorylation by PPM1D/WIP1 (PubMed:21283629). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12054757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12737517, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15790566, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16173922, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17785205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19223857, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20228063, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21283629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23152784, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23478299}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) May be negatively regulated by hepatitis B virus large envelope protein mutant pre-s2 to promote mitotic entry.","keywords":["Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Host-virus interaction","Isopeptide bond","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16173922}.

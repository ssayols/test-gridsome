This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1317798}.; FUNCTION: Binds to the intracellular domain of tumor necrosis factor type 1 receptor. The binding domain of TRAP1 and TRAP2 resides outside the death domain of TNFR1.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Direct protein sequencing","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Proteasome","Reference proteome","Repeat"],"subcellularLocation":"","domain":"","geneNames":["PSMD2","TRAP2"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","extracellular region [GO:0005576]","ficolin-1-rich granule lumen [GO:1904813]","membrane [GO:0016020]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]","proteasome accessory complex [GO:0022624]","proteasome complex [GO:0000502]","proteasome regulatory particle [GO:0005838]","proteasome regulatory particle, base subcomplex [GO:0008540]","proteasome storage granule [GO:0034515]","secretory granule lumen [GO:0034774]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["anaphase-promoting complex-dependent catabolic process [GO:0031145]","antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class I, TAP-dependent [GO:0002479]","Fc-epsilon receptor signaling pathway [GO:0038095]","interleukin-1-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0070498]","MAPK cascade [GO:0000165]","negative regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway [GO:0090090]","negative regulation of G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0010972]","neutrophil degranulation [GO:0043312]","NIK/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:0038061]","positive regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway [GO:0090263]","post-translational protein modification [GO:0043687]","proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0043161]","protein deubiquitination [GO:0016579]","protein polyubiquitination [GO:0000209]","regulation of cellular amino acid metabolic process [GO:0006521]","regulation of hematopoietic stem cell differentiation [GO:1902036]","regulation of mitotic cell cycle phase transition [GO:1901990]","regulation of mRNA stability [GO:0043488]","regulation of protein catabolic process [GO:0042176]","regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter in response to hypoxia [GO:0061418]","SCF-dependent proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0031146]","stimulatory C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway [GO:0002223]","T cell receptor signaling pathway [GO:0050852]","transmembrane transport [GO:0055085]","tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0033209]","Wnt signaling pathway, planar cell polarity pathway [GO:0060071]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["enzyme regulator activity [GO:0030234]"]}},"context":{}}

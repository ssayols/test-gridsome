Plays a role in the regulation of interphase large-scale gene-rich chromatin organization through chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs) in a transcription-dependent manner, and thereby maintains genomic stability (PubMed:1324173, PubMed:8174554, PubMed:28622508). Required for the localization of the long non-coding Xist RNA on the inactive chromosome X (Xi) and the subsequent initiation and maintenance of X-linked transcriptional gene silencing during X-inactivation (By similarity). Plays a role as a RNA polymerase II (Pol II) holoenzyme transcription regulator (PubMed:8174554, PubMed:9353307, PubMed:10490622, PubMed:15711563, PubMed:19617346, PubMed:23811339). Promotes transcription initiation by direct association with the core-TFIIH basal transcription factor complex for the assembly of a functional pre-initiation complex with Pol II in a actin-dependent manner (PubMed:10490622, PubMed:15711563). Blocks Pol II transcription elongation activity by inhibiting the C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylation of Pol II and dissociates from Pol II pre-initiation complex prior to productive transcription elongation (PubMed:10490622). Positively regulates CBX5-induced transcriptional gene silencing and retention of CBX5 in the nucleus (PubMed:19617346). Negatively regulates glucocorticoid-mediated transcriptional activation (PubMed:9353307). Key regulator of transcription initiation and elongation in embryonic stem cells upon leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling (By similarity). Involved in the long non-coding RNA H19-mediated Pol II transcriptional repression (PubMed:23811339). Participates in the circadian regulation of the core clock component ARNTL/BMAL1 transcription (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of telomere length (PubMed:18082603). Plays a role as a global pre-mRNA alternative splicing modulator by regulating U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) biogenesis (PubMed:22325991). Plays a role in mRNA stability (PubMed:17174306, PubMed:17289661, PubMed:19029303). Component of the CRD-mediated complex that promotes MYC mRNA stabilization (PubMed:19029303). Enhances the expression of specific genes, such as tumor necrosis factor TNFA, by regulating mRNA stability, possibly through binding to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) (PubMed:17174306). Plays a role in mitotic cell cycle regulation (PubMed:21242313, PubMed:25986610). Involved in the formation of stable mitotic spindle microtubules (MTs) attachment to kinetochore, spindle organization and chromosome congression (PubMed:21242313). Phosphorylation at Ser-59 by PLK1 is required for chromosome alignement and segregation and progression through mitosis (PubMed:25986610). Contributes also to the targeting of AURKA to mitotic spindle MTs (PubMed:21242313). Binds to double- and single-stranded DNA and RNA, poly(A), poly(C) and poly(G) oligoribonucleotides (PubMed:1628625, PubMed:8068679, PubMed:8174554, PubMed:9204873, PubMed:9405365). Binds to chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs) (PubMed:28622508). Associates with chromatin to scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/MAR) elements in a chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs)-dependent manner (PubMed:7509195, PubMed:1324173, PubMed:9204873, PubMed:9405365, PubMed:10671544, PubMed:11003645, PubMed:11909954, PubMed:28622508).

Binds to small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (PubMed:22325991). Binds to the 3'-UTR of TNFA mRNA (PubMed:17174306). Binds (via RNA-binding RGG-box region) to the long non-coding Xist RNA; this binding is direct and bridges the Xist RNA and the inactive chromosome X (Xi) (By similarity). Also negatively regulates embryonic stem cell differentiation upon LIF signaling (By similarity). Required for embryonic development (By similarity). Binds to brown fat long non-coding RNA 1 (Blnc1); facilitates the recruitment of Blnc1 by ZBTB7B required to drive brown and beige fat development and thermogenesis (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8VEK3, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10490622, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10671544, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11003645, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11909954, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1324173, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15711563, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1628625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17174306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17289661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18082603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19029303, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19617346, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21242313, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22325991, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23811339, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25986610, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26244333, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28622508, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7509195, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8068679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8174554, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9204873, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9353307, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9405365}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Negatively regulates immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication by preventing the accumulation of viral mRNA transcripts in the cytoplasm. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16916646}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ADP-ribosylation","ATP-binding","Acetylation","Activator","Alternative splicing","Biological rhythms","Cell cycle","Cell division","Centromere","Chromatin regulator","Chromosome","Citrullination","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","DNA-binding","Developmental protein","Differentiation","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Epilepsy","Host-virus interaction","Isopeptide bond","Kinetochore","Methylation","Mitosis","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Repressor","Ribonucleoprotein","Spliceosome","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Ubl conjugation","mRNA processing","mRNA splicing"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10671544, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11003645, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1324173, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14608463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15563465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19617346, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21242313, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8174554, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9353307, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9405365}.

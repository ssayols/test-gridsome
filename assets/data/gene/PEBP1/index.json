Has lower affinity for phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine. Serine protease inhibitor which inhibits thrombin, neuropsin and chymotrypsin but not trypsin, tissue type plasminogen activator and elastase (By similarity). Inhibits the kinase activity of RAF1 by inhibiting its activation and by dissociating the RAF1/MEK complex and acting as a competitive inhibitor of MEK phosphorylation. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18294816}.; FUNCTION: HCNP may be involved in the function of the presynaptic cholinergic neurons of the central nervous system. HCNP increases the production of choline acetyltransferase but not acetylcholinesterase. Seems to be mediated by a specific receptor (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Disulfide bond","Lipid-binding","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Protease inhibitor","Reference proteome","Serine protease inhibitor"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250}.","domain":"","geneNames":["PEBP1","PBP","PEBP"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["MAPK cascade [GO:0000165]","negative regulation of MAPK cascade [GO:0043409]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["ATP binding [GO:0005524]","enzyme binding [GO:0019899]","phosphatidylethanolamine binding [GO:0008429]","protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]","RNA binding [GO:0003723]","serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity [GO:0004867]"]}},"context":{}}

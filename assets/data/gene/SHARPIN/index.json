LUBAC conjugates linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and RIPK1 and is involved in activation of the canonical NF-kappa-B and the JNK signaling pathways. Linear ubiquitination mediated by the LUBAC complex interferes with TNF-induced cell death and thereby prevents inflammation. LUBAC is recruited to the TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC) following polyubiquitination of TNF-RSC components by BIRC2 and/or BIRC3 and to conjugate linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and possibly other components contributing to the stability of the complex. Together with OTULIN, the LUBAC complex regulates the canonical Wnt signaling during angiogenesis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21455173, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21455180, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21455181}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Cell junction","Cytoplasm","Metal-binding","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Synapse","Ubl conjugation pathway","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20179993}.

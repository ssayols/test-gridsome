Cytoplasmic dynein 1 acts as a motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules. May play a role in changing or maintaining the spatial distribution of cytoskeletal structures.; FUNCTION: Binds and inhibits the catalytic activity of neuronal nitric oxide synthase.; FUNCTION: Promotes transactivation functions of ESR1 and plays a role in the nuclear localization of ESR1.; FUNCTION: Regulates apoptotic activities of BCL2L11 by sequestering it to microtubules. Upon apoptotic stimuli the BCL2L11-DYNLL1 complex dissociates from cytoplasmic dynein and translocates to mitochondria and sequesters BCL2 thus neutralizing its antiapoptotic activity.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Activator","Apoptosis","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Dynein","Host-virus interaction","Isopeptide bond","Microtubule","Mitochondrion","Motor protein","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Transport","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, microtubule organizing center, centrosome {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14654843}.

Activated by amino acids through a mechanism involving the lysosomal V-ATPase, the Ragulator functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor activating the small GTPases Rag. Activated Ragulator and Rag GTPases function as a scaffold recruiting mTORC1 to lysosomes where it is in turn activated. LAMTOR1 is directly responsible for anchoring the Ragulator complex to membranes. Also required for late endosomes/lysosomes biogenesis it may regulate both the recycling of receptors through endosomes and the MAPK signaling pathway through recruitment of some of its components to late endosomes. May be involved in cholesterol homeostasis regulating LDL uptake and cholesterol release from late endosomes/lysosomes. May also play a role in RHOA activation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19654316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20381137, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20544018, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22980980}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Cell membrane","Direct protein sequencing","Endosome","Lipoprotein","Lysosome","Membrane","Myristate","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Late endosome membrane; Lipid-anchor; Cytoplasmic side.

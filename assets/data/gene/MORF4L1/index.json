This modification may both alter nucleosome - DNA interactions and promote interaction of the modified histones with other proteins which positively regulate transcription. This complex may be required for the activation of transcriptional programs associated with oncogene and proto-oncogene mediated growth induction, tumor suppressor mediated growth arrest and replicative senescence, apoptosis, and DNA repair. The NuA4 complex ATPase and helicase activities seem to be, at least in part, contributed by the association of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 with EP400. NuA4 may also play a direct role in DNA repair when directly recruited to sites of DNA damage. Also component of the mSin3A complex which acts to repress transcription by deacetylation of nucleosomal histones. Required for homologous recombination repair (HRR) and resistance to mitomycin C (MMC). Involved in the localization of PALB2, BRCA2 and RAD51, but not BRCA1, to DNA-damage foci. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14966270, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20332121}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Chromatin regulator","DNA damage","DNA recombination","DNA repair","Direct protein sequencing","Growth regulation","Nucleus","Reference proteome","Transcription","Transcription regulation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.","domain":"DOMAIN 191..362;  /note=\"MRG\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00972\"","geneNames":["MORF4L1","MRG15","FWP006","HSPC008","HSPC061","PP368"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["histone acetyltransferase complex [GO:0000123]","NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex [GO:0035267]","nuclear speck [GO:0016607]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","Sin3 complex [GO:0016580]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cell population proliferation [GO:0008283]","chromatin silencing [GO:0006342]","double-strand break repair via homologous recombination [GO:0000724]","histone acetylation [GO:0016573]","histone deacetylation [GO:0016575]","histone H2A acetylation [GO:0043968]","histone H4 acetylation [GO:0043967]","regulation of growth [GO:0040008]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["chromatin binding [GO:0003682]","protein N-terminus binding [GO:0047485]"]}},"context":{}}

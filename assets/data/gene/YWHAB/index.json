Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner. Negative regulator of osteogenesis. Blocks the nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated form (by AKT1) of SRPK2 and antagonizes its stimulatory effect on cyclin D1 expression resulting in blockage of neuronal apoptosis elicited by SRPK2. Negative regulator of signaling cascades that mediate activation of MAP kinases via AKAP13. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17717073, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19592491, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21224381}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative initiation","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Host-virus interaction","Isopeptide bond","Membrane","Nitration","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation","Vacuole"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17081065}.

Cleaves the beta-aspartyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) of the glycan and the amide side chain of Asn, converting Asn to Asp. Prefers proteins containing high-mannose over those bearing complex type oligosaccharides. Can recognize misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum that are exported to the cytosol to be destroyed and deglycosylate them, while it has no activity toward native proteins. Deglycosylation is a prerequisite for subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of some, but not all, misfolded glycoproteins. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14749736, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15358861}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Hydrolase","Metal-binding","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Zinc"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15358861}.","domain":"DOMAIN 30..91;  /note=\"PUB\"; DOMAIN 454..654;  /note=\"PAW\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00731\"","geneNames":["NGLY1","PNG1"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["glycoprotein catabolic process [GO:0006516]","protein deglycosylation [GO:0006517]","protein folding [GO:0006457]","protein quality control for misfolded or incompletely synthesized proteins [GO:0006515]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["metal ion binding [GO:0046872]","peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase activity [GO:0000224]"]}},"context":{}}

Note=Has a punctate cytoplasmic distribution as well as centrosomal distribution typical of dynactin (PubMed:10671518). Overexpression in cultured mammalian cells revealed colocalization with cortical actin, stress fibers, and focal adhesion sites, sites of potential interaction between microtubules and the cell cortex (By similarity). In skeletal muscles, costamere localization requires the presence of ANK2 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8CBY8, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9QUR2, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10671518}.","domain":"","geneNames":["DCTN4"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cell cortex [GO:0005938]","centrosome [GO:0005813]","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytoplasmic dynein complex [GO:0005868]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","dynactin complex [GO:0005869]","focal adhesion [GO:0005925]","kinetochore [GO:0000776]","nucleus [GO:0005634]","sarcomere [GO:0030017]","spindle pole [GO:0000922]","stress fiber [GO:0001725]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class II [GO:0019886]","endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport [GO:0006888]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["protein N-terminus binding [GO:0047485]"]}},"context":{}}

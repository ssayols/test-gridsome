The UBE2V1-UBE2N heterodimer catalyzes the synthesis of non-canonical poly-ubiquitin chains that are linked through Lys-63. This type of poly-ubiquitination activates IKK and does not seem to involve protein degradation by the proteasome. Plays a role in the activation of NF-kappa-B mediated by IL1B, TNF, TRAF6 and TRAF2. Mediates transcriptional activation of target genes. Plays a role in the control of progress through the cell cycle and differentiation. Plays a role in the error-free DNA repair pathway and contributes to the survival of cells after DNA damage. Promotes TRIM5 capsid-specific restriction activity and the UBE2V1-UBE2N heterodimer acts in concert with TRIM5 to generate 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains which activate the MAP3K7/TAK1 complex which in turn results in the induction and expression of NF-kappa-B and MAPK-responsive inflammatory genes. Together with RNF135 and UBE2N, catalyzes the viral RNA-dependent 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I/DDX58 to activate the downstream signaling pathway that leads to interferon beta production (PubMed:31006531). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11057907, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20061386, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21512573, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31006531, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9305758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9418904, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9580084, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9705497}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Direct protein sequencing","Nucleus","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation pathway"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11076860, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9305758}.

Displays enzymatic activity towards endogenous metabolites such as aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, ketones, monosacharides, bile acids and xenobiotics substrates. Key enzyme in the polyol pathway, catalyzes reduction of glucose to sorbitol during hyperglycemia (PubMed:1936586). Reduces steroids and their derivatives and prostaglandins. Displays low enzymatic activity toward all-trans-retinal, 9-cis-retinal, and 13-cis-retinal (PubMed:12732097, PubMed:19010934, PubMed:8343525). Catalyzes the reduction of diverse phospholipid aldehydes such as 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn -glycero-3-phosphoethanolamin (POVPC) and related phospholipid aldehydes that are generated from the oxydation of phosphotidylcholine and phosphatdyleethanolamides (PubMed:17381426). Plays a role in detoxifying dietary and lipid-derived unsaturated carbonyls, such as crotonaldehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal, trans-2-hexenal, trans-2,4-hexadienal and their glutathione-conjugates carbonyls (GS-carbonyls) (PubMed:21329684). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12732097, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17381426, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19010934, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1936586, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21329684, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8343525}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","NADP","Oxidoreductase","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.","domain":"","geneNames":["AKR1B1","ALDR1","ALR2"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","extracellular space [GO:0005615]","mast cell granule [GO:0042629]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","paranodal junction [GO:0033010]","perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]","plasma membrane bounded cell projection cytoplasm [GO:0032838]","Schmidt-Lanterman incisure [GO:0043220]","Schwann cell microvillus [GO:0097454]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["C21-steroid hormone biosynthetic process [GO:0006700]","carbohydrate metabolic process [GO:0005975]","cellular hyperosmotic salinity response [GO:0071475]","cellular response to methylglyoxal [GO:0097238]","cellular response to peptide [GO:1901653]","daunorubicin metabolic process [GO:0044597]","doxorubicin metabolic process [GO:0044598]","epithelial cell maturation [GO:0002070]","fructose biosynthetic process [GO:0046370]","inner medullary collecting duct development [GO:0072061]","maternal process involved in female pregnancy [GO:0060135]","metanephric collecting duct development [GO:0072205]","naphthalene metabolic process [GO:0018931]","negative regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043066]","norepinephrine metabolic process [GO:0042415]","oxidation-reduction process [GO:0055114]","positive regulation of receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT [GO:0046427]","positive regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation [GO:0048661]","regulation of urine volume [GO:0035809]","renal water homeostasis [GO:0003091]","response to thyroid hormone [GO:0097066]","response to water deprivation [GO:0009414]","retinoid metabolic process [GO:0001523]","sorbitol biosynthetic process [GO:0006061]","stress-activated protein kinase signaling cascade [GO:0031098]","tissue homeostasis [GO:0001894]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP+) activity [GO:0008106]","alditol:NADP+ 1-oxidoreductase activity [GO:0004032]","allyl-alcohol dehydrogenase activity [GO:0047655]","electron transfer activity [GO:0009055]","glyceraldehyde oxidoreductase activity [GO:0043795]","NADP-retinol dehydrogenase activity [GO:0052650]","oxidoreductase activity [GO:0016491]","retinal dehydrogenase activity [GO:0001758]"]}},"context":{}}

Required for normal progress through the cell cycle, both during interphase and during mitosis (PubMed:23388455, PubMed:12919680, PubMed:26158537). Required for the presence of normal levels of MAD2L1, AURKB and BIRC5 on inner centromeres during mitosis, and for normal attachment of kinetochores to mitotic spindles (PubMed:12919680, PubMed:26158537). Required for normal organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton in interphase cells (PubMed:23388455). Functions as guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RALA (PubMed:26158537). Interferes with the activation of RAC1 by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (PubMed:25074804). Prevents accumulation of active, GTP-bound RAC1, and suppresses RAC1-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and formation of membrane protrusions (PubMed:25074804, PubMed:28869598). Required for normal cellular responses to contacts with the extracellular matrix of adjacent cells, and for directional cell migration in response to a fibronectin gradient (in vitro) (PubMed:25074804, PubMed:28869598). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12919680, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23388455, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25074804, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26158537, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28869598}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Cell cycle","Cell division","Cell membrane","Centromere","Chromosome","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Guanine-nucleotide releasing factor","Membrane","Microtubule","Mitosis","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Repeat"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus, nucleolus {ECO:0000305|PubMed:12429849}.

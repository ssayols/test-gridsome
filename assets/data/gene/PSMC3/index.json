This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair. PSMC3 belongs to the heterohexameric ring of AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) proteins that unfolds ubiquitinated target proteins that are concurrently translocated into a proteolytic chamber and degraded into peptides. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1317798}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Acetylation","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Host-virus interaction","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Proteasome","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000305}.

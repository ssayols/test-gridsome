Mediates their targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum but also regulates their sorting to the proteasome when targeting fails (PubMed:28104892). Functions in tail-anchored/type II transmembrane proteins membrane insertion constituting with ASNA1 and the BAG6 complex a targeting module (PubMed:28104892). Functions upstream of the BAG6 complex and ASNA1, binding more rapidly the transmembrane domain of newly synthesized proteins (PubMed:28104892, PubMed:25535373). It is also involved in the regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated misfolded protein catabolic process via its interaction with BAG6: collaborates with the BAG6 complex to maintain hydrophobic substrates in non-ubiquitinated states (PubMed:23129660, PubMed:25179605). Competes with RNF126 for interaction with BAG6, preventing the ubiquitination of client proteins associated with the BAG6 complex (PubMed:27193484). Binds directly to HSC70 and HSP70 and regulates their ATPase activity (PubMed:18759457). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18759457, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23129660, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25179605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25535373, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27193484, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28104892}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) In case of infection by polyomavirus, involved in the virus endoplasmic reticulum membrane penetration and infection via interaction with DNAJB12, DNAJB14 and HSPA8/Hsc70 (PubMed:24675744). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24675744}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Chaperone","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Host-virus interaction","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Repeat","TPR repeat"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16580629}.

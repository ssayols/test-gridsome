Phospholipid translocation seems also to be implicated in vesicle formation and in uptake of lipid signaling molecules. The beta subunit may assist in binding of the phospholipid substrate. Required for the proper folding, assembly and ER to Golgi exit of the ATP8A2:TMEM30A flippase complex. ATP8A2:TMEM30A may be involved in regulation of neurite outgrowth, and, reconstituted to liposomes, predomiminantly transports phosphatidylserine (PS) and to a lesser extent phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The ATP8A1:TMEM30A flippase complex seems to play a role in regulation of cell migration probably involving flippase-mediated translocation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) at the plasma membrane. Required for the formation of the ATP8A2, ATP8B1 and ATP8B2 P-type ATPAse intermediate phosphoenzymes. Involved in uptake of platelet-activating factor (PAF), synthetic drug alkylphospholipid edelfosine, and, probably in association with ATP8B1, of perifosine. Also mediates the export of alpha subunits ATP8A1, ATP8B1, ATP8B2, ATP8B4, ATP10A, ATP10B, ATP10D, ATP11A, ATP11B and ATP11C from the ER to other membrane localizations. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20510206, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20947505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20961850, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21289302}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cell membrane","Cytoplasmic vesicle","Glycoprotein","Golgi apparatus","Lipid transport","Membrane","Reference proteome","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix","Transport"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane {ECO:0000250}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000250}.

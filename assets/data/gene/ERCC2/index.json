In NER, TFIIH acts by opening DNA around the lesion to allow the excision of the damaged oligonucleotide and its replacement by a new DNA fragment. The ATP-dependent helicase activity of XPD/ERCC2 is required for DNA opening. In transcription, TFIIH has an essential role in transcription initiation. When the pre-initiation complex (PIC) has been established, TFIIH is required for promoter opening and promoter escape. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II by the kinase module CAK controls the initiation of transcription. XPD/ERCC2 acts by forming a bridge between CAK and the core-TFIIH complex. Involved in the regulation of vitamin-D receptor activity. As part of the mitotic spindle-associated MMXD complex it plays a role in chromosome segregation. Might have a role in aging process and could play a causative role in the generation of skin cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10024882, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15494306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20797633, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8413672}.","keywords":["3D-structure","4Fe-4S","ATP-binding","Alternative splicing","Cataract","Chromosome partition","Cockayne syndrome","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","DNA damage","DNA repair","DNA-binding","Deafness","Disease mutation","Dwarfism","Helicase","Host-virus interaction","Hydrolase","Ichthyosis","Iron","Iron-sulfur","Magnesium","Metal-binding","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Ubl conjugation","Xeroderma pigmentosum"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20797633, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23585563}.

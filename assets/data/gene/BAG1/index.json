Acts as a nucleotide-exchange factor (NEF) promoting the release of ADP from the HSP70 and HSC70 proteins thereby triggering client/substrate protein release. Nucleotide release is mediated via its binding to the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of HSPA8/HSC70 where as the substrate release is mediated via its binding to the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of HSPA8/HSC70 (PubMed:27474739, PubMed:9873016, PubMed:24318877). Inhibits the pro-apoptotic function of PPP1R15A, and has anti-apoptotic activity (PubMed:12724406). Markedly increases the anti-cell death function of BCL2 induced by various stimuli (PubMed:9305631). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12724406, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24318877, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27474739, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9305631, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9873016}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative initiation","Alternative splicing","Apoptosis","Chaperone","Cytoplasm","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Repeat","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: [Isoform 1]: Nucleus.

Note=Isoform 4 localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm. The cellular background in which it is expressed can influence whether it resides primarily in the cytoplasm or is also found in the nucleus. In the presence of BCL2, localizes to intracellular membranes (what appears to be the nuclear envelope and perinuclear membranes) as well as punctate cytosolic structures suggestive of mitochondria.","domain":"DOMAIN 144..224;  /note=\"Ubiquitin-like\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00214\"; DOMAIN 246..326;  /note=\"BAG\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00369\"","geneNames":["BAG1","HAP"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["apoptotic process [GO:0006915]","cell surface receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007166]","chaperone cofactor-dependent protein refolding [GO:0051085]","negative regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043066]","regulation of cellular response to heat [GO:1900034]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["adenyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity [GO:0000774]","chaperone binding [GO:0051087]","ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]"]}},"context":{}}

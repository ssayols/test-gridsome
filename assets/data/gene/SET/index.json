Isoform 2 anti-apoptotic activity is mediated by inhibition of the GZMA-activated DNase, NME1. In the course of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-induced apoptosis, GZMA cleaves SET, disrupting its binding to NME1 and releasing NME1 inhibition. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 are potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2A. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 inhibit EP300/CREBBP and PCAF-mediated acetylation of histones (HAT) and nucleosomes, most probably by masking the accessibility of lysines of histones to the acetylases. The predominant target for inhibition is histone H4. HAT inhibition leads to silencing of HAT-dependent transcription and prevents active demethylation of DNA. Both isoforms stimulate DNA replication of the adenovirus genome complexed with viral core proteins; however, isoform 2 specific activity is higher. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11555662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12628186}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Chaperone","Chromosomal rearrangement","Cytoplasm","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Endoplasmic reticulum","Host-virus interaction","Isopeptide bond","Mental retardation","Methylation","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Proto-oncogene","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol.

Also required for the transfer of beta-barrel precursors from the TOM complex to the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) of the outer membrane. Acts as a chaperone-like protein that protects the hydrophobic precursors from aggregation and guide them through the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The TIMM8-TIMM13 complex mediates the import of proteins such as TIMM23, SLC25A12/ARALAR1 and SLC25A13/ARALAR2, while the predominant TIMM9-TIMM10 70 kDa complex mediates the import of much more proteins. Probably necessary for normal neurologic development. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11489896, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15254020}.","keywords":["Chaperone","Deafness","Disease mutation","Disulfide bond","Dystonia","Membrane","Metal-binding","Mitochondrion","Mitochondrion inner membrane","Phosphoprotein","Protein transport","Reference proteome","Translocation","Transport","Zinc"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion inner membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11489896}; Peripheral membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11489896}; Intermembrane side {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11489896}.","domain":"","geneNames":["TIMM8A","DDP","DDP1","TIM8A"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["mitochondrial inner membrane [GO:0005743]","mitochondrial intermembrane space [GO:0005758]","mitochondrion [GO:0005739]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["chaperone-mediated protein transport [GO:0072321]","nervous system development [GO:0007399]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["metal ion binding [GO:0046872]"]}},"context":{}}

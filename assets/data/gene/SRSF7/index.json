Can also modulate alternative splicing in vitro. Represses the splicing of MAPT/Tau exon 10. May function as export adapter involved in mRNA nuclear export such as of histone H2A. Binds mRNA which is thought to be transferred to the NXF1-NXT1 heterodimer for export (TAP/NXF1 pathway); enhances NXF1-NXT1 RNA-binding activity. RNA-binding is semi-sequence specific. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11336712, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12667464, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15009664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18364396}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Isopeptide bond","Metal-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Repeat","Repressor","Transport","Ubl conjugation","Zinc","Zinc-finger","mRNA processing","mRNA splicing","mRNA transport"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11336712}.

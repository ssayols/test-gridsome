May serve as a scaffold to bring together molecules to form signaling modules controlling vesicle trafficking, adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. Increases the speed of cell migration, as well as the size and rate of formation of protrusions, possibly by targeting PAK1 to adhesions and the leading edge of lamellipodia. Sequesters inactive non-tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin in cytoplasmic complexes. Involved in the regulation of cytokinesis; the function may involve ENTR1 and PTPN13 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q68FF6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11896197}.","keywords":["ANK repeat","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","GTPase activation","Metal-binding","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Repeat","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11896197}. Note=Cycles between at least 3 distinct intracellular compartments, including focal adhesions, cytoplasmic complexes and membrane protrusions. During cell migration, when cells detach, moves from the adhesions into the cytoplasmic complexes towards the leading edge, while, when cells adhere, it is found in vinculin-containing adhesions. Recruitment to adhesions may be mediated by active tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin.","domain":"DOMAIN 1..124;  /note=\"Arf-GAP\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00288\"","geneNames":["GIT1"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["calyx of Held [GO:0044305]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","focal adhesion [GO:0005925]","membrane [GO:0016020]","mitochondrion [GO:0005739]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["ephrin receptor signaling pathway [GO:0048013]","presynaptic modulation of chemical synaptic transmission [GO:0099171]","regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032465]","regulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0008277]","regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis [GO:2000300]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["GTPase activator activity [GO:0005096]","metal ion binding [GO:0046872]","protein-containing complex binding [GO:0044877]"]}},"context":{}}

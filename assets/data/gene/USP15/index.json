Acts as a key regulator of TGF-beta receptor signaling pathway, but the precise mechanism is still unclear: according to a report, acts by promoting deubiquitination of monoubiquitinated R-SMADs (SMAD1, SMAD2 and/or SMAD3), thereby alleviating inhibition of R-SMADs and promoting activation of TGF-beta target genes (PubMed:21947082). According to another reports, regulates the TGF-beta receptor signaling pathway by mediating deubiquitination and stabilization of TGFBR1, leading to an enhanced TGF-beta signal (PubMed:22344298). Able to mediate deubiquitination of monoubiquitinated substrates as well as 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains, protecting them against proteasomal degradation. May also regulate gene expression and/or DNA repair through the deubiquitination of histone H2B (PubMed:24526689). Acts as an inhibitor of mitophagy by counteracting the action of parkin (PRKN): hydrolyzes cleavage of 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains attached by parkin on target proteins such as MFN2, thereby reducing parkin's ability to drive mitophagy (PubMed:24852371). Acts as an associated component of COP9 signalosome complex (CSN) and regulates different pathways via this association: regulates NF-kappa-B by mediating deubiquitination of NFKBIA and deubiquitinates substrates bound to VCP (PubMed:16005295, PubMed:17318178, PubMed:19826004, PubMed:19576224). Involved in endosome organization by mediating deubiquitination of SQSTM1: ubiquitinated SQSTM1 forms a molecular bridge that restrains cognate vesicles in the perinuclear region and its deubiquitination releases target vesicles for fast transport into the cell periphery (PubMed:27368102). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16005295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17318178, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19576224, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19826004, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21947082, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22344298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24526689, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24852371, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27368102}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Protects APC and human papillomavirus type 16 protein E6 against degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19553310}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Host-virus interaction","Hydrolase","Mitochondrion","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Protease","Reference proteome","Thiol protease","Ubl conjugation","Ubl conjugation pathway"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21947082, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24526689}.

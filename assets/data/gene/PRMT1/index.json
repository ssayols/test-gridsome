Constitutes the main enzyme that mediates monomethylation and asymmetric dimethylation of histone H4 'Arg-4' (H4R3me1 and H4R3me2a, respectively), a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation. May be involved in the regulation of TAF15 transcriptional activity, act as an activator of estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated transactivation, play a key role in neurite outgrowth and act as a negative regulator of megakaryocytic differentiation, by modulating p38 MAPK pathway. Methylates RBM15, promoting ubiquitination and degradation of RBM15 (PubMed:26575292). Methylates FOXO1 and retains it in the nucleus increasing its transcriptional activity. Methylates CHTOP and this methylation is critical for its 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)-binding activity (PubMed:25284789). Methylates H4R3 in genes involved in glioblastomagenesis in a CHTOP- and/or TET1-dependent manner (PubMed:25284789). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10749851, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387442, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11448779, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12718890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16879614, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18320585, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18657504, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18773938, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19124016, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19405910, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20442406, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25284789, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26575292, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26876602, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28040436}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Isopeptide bond","Methyltransferase","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","S-adenosyl-L-methionine","Transferase","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10749851, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387442, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16879614}.

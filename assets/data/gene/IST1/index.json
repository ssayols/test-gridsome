Is required for efficient abscission during cytokinesis, but not for HIV-1 budding. The involvement in the MVB pathway is not established. Involved in recruiting VPS4A and/or VPS4B to the midbody of dividing cells (PubMed:19129479, PubMed:19129480). During late anaphase, involved in nuclear envelope reassembly and mitotic spindle disassembly together with the ESCRT-III complex: IST1 acts by mediating the recruitment of SPAST to the nuclear membrane, leading to microtubule severing (PubMed:26040712). Regulates early endosomal tubulation together with the ESCRT-III complex by mediating the recruitment of SPAST (PubMed:23897888). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19129479, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19129480, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23897888, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26040712}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Cell cycle","Cell division","Cytoplasm","Cytoplasmic vesicle","Cytoskeleton","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasmic vesicle {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19129479, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19129480}.

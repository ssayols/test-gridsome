Stimulates POU5F1-mediated transcriptional activation. Plays a general role in caspase independent cell death of tumor cells. The ratio between the highly active tetrameric form and nearly inactive dimeric form determines whether glucose carbons are channeled to biosynthetic processes or used for glycolytic ATP production. The transition between the 2 forms contributes to the control of glycolysis and is important for tumor cell proliferation and survival (PubMed:17308100, PubMed:18191611, PubMed:21620138). Promotes in a STAT1-dependent manner, the expression of the immune checkpoint protein CD274 in ARNTL/BMAL1-deficient macrophages (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P52480, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17308100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18191611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21620138}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Acetylation","Allosteric enzyme","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Glycolysis","Hydroxylation","Isopeptide bond","Kinase","Magnesium","Metal-binding","Methylation","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Potassium","Pyruvate","Reference proteome","Transferase","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25263439}.

PAF1C associates with RNA polymerase II through interaction with POLR2A CTD non-phosphorylated and 'Ser-2'- and 'Ser-5'-phosphorylated forms and is involved in transcriptional elongation, acting both indepentently and synergistically with TCEA1 and in cooperation with the DSIF complex and HTATSF1. PAF1C is required for transcription of Hox and Wnt target genes. PAF1C is involved in hematopoiesis and stimulates transcriptional activity of KMT2A/MLL1; it promotes leukemogenesis through association with KMT2A/MLL1-rearranged oncoproteins, such as KMT2A/MLL1-MLLT3/AF9 and KMT2A/MLL1-MLLT1/ENL. PAF1C is involved in histone modifications such as ubiquitination of histone H2B and methylation on histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me3). PAF1C recruits the RNF20/40 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex and the E2 enzyme UBE2A or UBE2B to chromatin which mediate monoubiquitination of 'Lys-120' of histone H2B (H2BK120ub1); UB2A/B-mediated H2B ubiquitination is proposed to be coupled to transcription. PAF1C is involved in mRNA 3' end formation probably through association with cleavage and poly(A) factors. In case of infection by influenza A strain H3N2, PAF1C associates with viral NS1 protein, thereby regulating gene transcription. Involved in polyadenylation of mRNA precursors. Connects PAF1C to Wnt signaling. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15632063, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15791002, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19345177, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19952111, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20178742}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Activator","Alternative splicing","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Wnt signaling pathway"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15791002}.","domain":"","geneNames":["LEO1","RDL"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["Cdc73/Paf1 complex [GO:0016593]","centrosome [GO:0005813]","fibrillar center [GO:0001650]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["beta-catenin-TCF complex assembly [GO:1904837]","endodermal cell fate commitment [GO:0001711]","histone H2B ubiquitination [GO:0033523]","histone monoubiquitination [GO:0010390]","mRNA polyadenylation [GO:0006378]","negative regulation of myeloid cell differentiation [GO:0045638]","positive regulation of mRNA 3'-end processing [GO:0031442]","positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0045944]","positive regulation of transcription elongation from RNA polymerase II promoter [GO:0032968]","protein ubiquitination [GO:0016567]","stem cell population maintenance [GO:0019827]","transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0006366]","transcription elongation from RNA polymerase II promoter [GO:0006368]","Wnt signaling pathway [GO:0016055]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain phosphoserine binding [GO:1990269]"]}},"context":{}}

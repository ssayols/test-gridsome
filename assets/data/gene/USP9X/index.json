May therefore play an important regulatory role at the level of protein turnover by preventing degradation of proteins through the removal of conjugated ubiquitin. Specifically hydrolyzes 'Lys-48'-, 'Lys-29'- and 'Lys-33'-linked polyubiquitins chains. Essential component of TGF-beta/BMP signaling cascade. Specifically deubiquitinates monoubiquitinated SMAD4, opposing the activity of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM33. Deubiquitinates alkylation repair enzyme ALKBH3. OTUD4 recruits USP7 and USP9X to stabilize ALKBH3, thereby promoting the repair of alkylated DNA lesions (PubMed:25944111). Regulates chromosome alignment and segregation in mitosis by regulating the localization of BIRC5/survivin to mitotic centromeres. Involved in axonal growth and neuronal cell migration (PubMed:16322459, PubMed:18254724, PubMed:19135894, PubMed:24607389). Regulates cellular clock function by enhancing the protein stability and transcriptional activity of the core circadian protein ARNTL/BMAL1 via its deubiquitinating activity (PubMed:29626158). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16322459, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18254724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19135894, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24607389, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25944111, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29626158}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Biological rhythms","Cell cycle","Cell division","Cell projection","Chromosome partition","Cytoplasm","Disease mutation","Hydrolase","Mental retardation","Mitosis","Phosphoprotein","Protease","Reference proteome","Thiol protease","Ubl conjugation pathway"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19135894}.

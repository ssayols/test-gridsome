Facilitates the MDM2-p53/TP53 interaction which promotes ubiquitination- and MDM2-dependent proteasomal degradation of p53/TP53, limiting its accumulation and resulting in inhibited apoptosis after DNA damage. May also be involved in cell cycle regulation. Mediates CCAR2 and CHEK2-dependent SIRT1 inhibition (PubMed:25361978). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10835274, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11185562, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11432824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15111123, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18309296, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25361978, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9325261}.","keywords":["Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Apoptosis","Cell cycle","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Host-virus interaction","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Proteasome","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10657252, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12629132}.

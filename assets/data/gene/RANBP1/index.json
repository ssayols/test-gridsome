Alleviates the TNPO1-dependent inhibition of RAN GTPase activity and mediates the dissociation of RAN from proteins involved in transport into the nucleus (By similarity). Induces a conformation change in the complex formed by XPO1 and RAN that triggers the release of the nuclear export signal of cargo proteins (PubMed:20485264). Promotes the disassembly of the complex formed by RAN and importin beta. Promotes dissociation of RAN from a complex with KPNA2 and CSE1L (By similarity). Required for normal mitotic spindle assembly and normal progress through mitosis via its effect on RAN (PubMed:17671426). Does not increase the RAN GTPase activity by itself, but increases GTP hydrolysis mediated by RANGAP1 (PubMed:7882974). Inhibits RCC1-dependent exchange of RAN-bound GDP by GTP (PubMed:7882974, PubMed:7616957). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P34022, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17671426, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20485264, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7616957, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7882974}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Direct protein sequencing","GTPase activation","Isopeptide bond","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"","domain":"DOMAIN 26..164;  /note=\"RanBD1\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00164\"","geneNames":["RANBP1"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["centrosome [GO:0005813]","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","nuclear envelope [GO:0005635]","nuclear pore [GO:0005643]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["intracellular transport [GO:0046907]","positive regulation of mitotic centrosome separation [GO:0046604]","signal transduction [GO:0007165]","viral process [GO:0016032]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["cadherin binding [GO:0045296]","GDP-dissociation inhibitor activity [GO:0005092]","GTPase activator activity [GO:0005096]","Ran GTPase binding [GO:0008536]"]}},"context":{}}

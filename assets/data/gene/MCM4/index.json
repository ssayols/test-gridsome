The active ATPase sites in the MCM2-7 ring are formed through the interaction surfaces of two neighboring subunits such that a critical structure of a conserved arginine finger motif is provided in trans relative to the ATP-binding site of the Walker A box of the adjacent subunit. The six ATPase active sites, however, are likely to contribute differentially to the complex helicase activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16899510, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9305914}.","keywords":["ATP-binding","Acetylation","Cell cycle","DNA replication","DNA-binding","Helicase","Hydrolase","Isopeptide bond","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000250}.","domain":"DOMAIN 458..667;  /note=\"MCM\"","geneNames":["MCM4","CDC21"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["MCM complex [GO:0042555]","membrane [GO:0016020]","nuclear chromosome, telomeric region [GO:0000784]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["DNA replication [GO:0006260]","DNA strand elongation involved in DNA replication [GO:0006271]","DNA unwinding involved in DNA replication [GO:0006268]","double-strand break repair via break-induced replication [GO:0000727]","G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0000082]","mitotic DNA replication initiation [GO:1902975]","pre-replicative complex assembly involved in nuclear cell cycle DNA replication [GO:0006267]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["ATP binding [GO:0005524]","DNA helicase activity [GO:0003678]","DNA replication origin binding [GO:0003688]","single-stranded DNA binding [GO:0003697]"]}},"context":{}}

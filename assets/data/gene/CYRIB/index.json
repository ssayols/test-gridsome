Regulates chemotaxis, cell migration and epithelial polarization by controlling the polarity, plasticity, duration and extent of protrusions. Limits Rac1 mediated activation of the Scar/WAVE complex, focuses protrusion signals and regulates pseudopod complexity by inhibiting Scar/WAVE-induced actin polymerization (PubMed:30250061). Protects against Salmonella bacterial infection. Attenuates processes such as macropinocytosis, phagocytosis and cell migration and restrict sopE-mediated bacterial entry (PubMed:31285585). Restricts also infection mediated by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes (By similarity). Involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and oxidative stress (PubMed:29059164). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q921M7, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29059164, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30250061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31285585}.","keywords":["Alternative splicing","Isopeptide bond","Lipoprotein","Membrane","Mitochondrion","Myristate","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane {ECO:0000305}; Lipid-anchor {ECO:0000305}.

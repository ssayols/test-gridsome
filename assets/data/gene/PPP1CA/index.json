Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is essential for cell division, and participates in the regulation of glycogen metabolism, muscle contractility and protein synthesis. Involved in regulation of ionic conductances and long-term synaptic plasticity. May play an important role in dephosphorylating substrates such as the postsynaptic density-associated Ca(2+)/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II. Component of the PTW/PP1 phosphatase complex, which plays a role in the control of chromatin structure and cell cycle progression during the transition from mitosis into interphase. Regulates NEK2 function in terms of kinase activity and centrosome number and splitting, both in the presence and absence of radiation-induced DNA damage. Regulator of neural tube and optic fissure closure, and enteric neural crest cell (ENCCs) migration during development. In balance with CSNK1D and CSNK1E, determines the circadian period length, through the regulation of the speed and rhythmicity of PER1 and PER2 phosphorylation. May dephosphorylate CSNK1D and CSNK1E. Dephosphorylates the 'Ser-418' residue of FOXP3 in regulatory T-cells (Treg) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, thereby inactivating FOXP3 and rendering Treg cells functionally defective (PubMed:23396208). Dephosphorylates CENPA (PubMed:25556658). Dephosphorylates the 'Ser-139' residue of ATG16L1 causing dissociation of ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex, thereby inhibiting autophagy (PubMed:26083323). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17283141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21712997, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23396208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25556658, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26083323}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Necessary for alphaviruses replication. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:29769351}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Carbohydrate metabolism","Cell cycle","Cell division","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Glycogen metabolism","Host-virus interaction","Hydrolase","Manganese","Metal-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Protein phosphatase","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11739654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29769351}.

In the presence of PPP1R8 relocalizes from the nucleus to nuclear speckles.

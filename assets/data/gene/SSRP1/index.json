The FACT complex is involved in multiple processes that require DNA as a template such as mRNA elongation, DNA replication and DNA repair. During transcription elongation the FACT complex acts as a histone chaperone that both destabilizes and restores nucleosomal structure. It facilitates the passage of RNA polymerase II and transcription by promoting the dissociation of one histone H2A-H2B dimer from the nucleosome, then subsequently promotes the reestablishment of the nucleosome following the passage of RNA polymerase II. The FACT complex is probably also involved in phosphorylation of 'Ser-392' of p53/TP53 via its association with CK2 (casein kinase II). Binds specifically to double-stranded DNA and at low levels to DNA modified by the antitumor agent cisplatin. May potentiate cisplatin-induced cell death by blocking replication and repair of modified DNA. Also acts as a transcriptional coactivator for p63/TP63. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10912001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11239457, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12374749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12934006, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16713563, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9489704, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9566881, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9836642}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Chromosome","DNA damage","DNA repair","DNA replication","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Host-virus interaction","Isopeptide bond","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10421373, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22002106}.

Functions as a bridge between polyubiquitinated cargo and autophagosomes. Interacts directly with both the cargo to become degraded and an autophagy modifier of the MAP1 LC3 family (PubMed:16286508, PubMed:20168092, PubMed:24128730, PubMed:28404643, PubMed:22622177). Along with WDFY3, involved in the formation and autophagic degradation of cytoplasmic ubiquitin-containing inclusions (p62 bodies, ALIS/aggresome-like induced structures). Along with WDFY3, required to recruit ubiquitinated proteins to PML bodies in the nucleus (PubMed:24128730, PubMed:20168092). May regulate the activation of NFKB1 by TNF-alpha, nerve growth factor (NGF) and interleukin-1. May play a role in titin/TTN downstream signaling in muscle cells. May regulate signaling cascades through ubiquitination. Adapter that mediates the interaction between TRAF6 and CYLD (By similarity). May be involved in cell differentiation, apoptosis, immune response and regulation of K(+) channels. Involved in endosome organization by retaining vesicles in the perinuclear cloud: following ubiquitination by RNF26, attracts specific vesicle-associated adapters, forming a molecular bridge that restrains cognate vesicles in the perinuclear region and organizes the endosomal pathway for efficient cargo transport (PubMed:27368102). Promotes relocalization of 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitinated STING1 to autophagosomes (PubMed:29496741). Acts as an activator of the NFE2L2/NRF2 pathway via interaction with KEAP1: interaction inactivates the BCR(KEAP1) complex, promoting nuclear accumulation of NFE2L2/NRF2 and subsequent expression of cytoprotective genes (PubMed:20452972, PubMed:28380357). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08623, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q64337, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10356400, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10747026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11244088, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12471037, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340068, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15802564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15911346, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15953362, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16079148, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16286508, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19931284, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20168092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20452972, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22622177, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24128730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27368102, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28380357, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28404643, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29496741}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","Apoptosis","Autophagy","Cytoplasm","Cytoplasmic vesicle","Differentiation","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Endoplasmic reticulum","Endosome","Immunity","Isopeptide bond","Lysosome","Metal-binding","Neurodegeneration","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20168092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22792322}.

Note=In cardiac muscle, localizes to the sarcomeric band (By similarity). Commonly found in inclusion bodies containing polyubiquitinated protein aggregates. In neurodegenerative diseases, detected in Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease, neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease, and HTT aggregates in Huntington disease. In protein aggregate diseases of the liver, found in large amounts in Mallory bodies of alcoholic and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hyaline bodies in hepatocellular carcinoma, and in SERPINA1 aggregates. Enriched in Rosenthal fibers of pilocytic astrocytoma. In the cytoplasm, observed in both membrane-free ubiquitin-containing protein aggregates (sequestosomes) and membrane-surrounded autophagosomes. Colocalizes with TRIM13 in the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum. Co-localizes with TRIM5 in cytoplasmic bodies. When nuclear export is blocked by treatment with leptomycin B, accumulates in PML bodies. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20168092}.","domain":"DOMAIN 3..102;  /note=\"PB1\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU01081\"; DOMAIN 389..434;  /note=\"UBA\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00212\"","geneNames":["SQSTM1","ORCA","OSIL"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["aggresome [GO:0016235]","amphisome [GO:0044753]","autolysosome [GO:0044754]","autophagosome [GO:0005776]","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","inclusion body [GO:0016234]","intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]","late endosome [GO:0005770]","Lewy body [GO:0097413]","mitochondrion [GO:0005739]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","P-body [GO:0000932]","phagophore assembly site [GO:0000407]","PML body [GO:0016605]","sarcomere [GO:0030017]","sperm midpiece [GO:0097225]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["aggrephagy [GO:0035973]","apoptotic process [GO:0006915]","autophagy [GO:0006914]","autophagy of mitochondrion [GO:0000422]","cell differentiation [GO:0030154]","endosomal transport [GO:0016197]","endosome organization [GO:0007032]","immune system process [GO:0002376]","interleukin-1-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0070498]","intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]","macroautophagy [GO:0016236]","mitochondrion organization [GO:0007005]","mitophagy [GO:0000423]","negative regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043066]","negative regulation of protein ubiquitination [GO:0031397]","negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]","positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]","positive regulation of long-term synaptic potentiation [GO:1900273]","positive regulation of protein localization to plasma membrane [GO:1903078]","positive regulation of protein phosphorylation [GO:0001934]","positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0045944]","protein localization [GO:0008104]","protein localization to perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:1905719]","regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:0043122]","regulation of mitochondrion organization [GO:0010821]","regulation of protein complex stability [GO:0061635]","regulation of Ras protein signal transduction [GO:0046578]","response to ischemia [GO:0002931]","response to mitochondrial depolarisation [GO:0098780]","selective autophagy [GO:0061912]","ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0006511]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["enzyme binding [GO:0019899]","identical protein binding [GO:0042802]","ionotropic glutamate receptor binding [GO:0035255]","K63-linked polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding [GO:0070530]","protein-containing complex binding [GO:0044877]","protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]","protein kinase C binding [GO:0005080]","protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]","receptor tyrosine kinase binding [GO:0030971]","SH2 domain binding [GO:0042169]","ubiquitin binding [GO:0043130]","ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]","zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]"]}},"context":{}}

The ATP gamma phosphate is transferred to the NDP beta phosphate via a ping-pong mechanism, using a phosphorylated active-site intermediate. Probably has a role in normal hematopoiesis by inhibition of granulocyte differentiation and induction of apoptosis.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Apoptosis","Kinase","Magnesium","Metal-binding","Nucleotide metabolism","Nucleotide-binding","Reference proteome","Transferase"],"subcellularLocation":"","domain":"","geneNames":["NME3"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["apoptotic process [GO:0006915]","CTP biosynthetic process [GO:0006241]","GTP biosynthetic process [GO:0006183]","nucleobase-containing small molecule interconversion [GO:0015949]","purine nucleotide metabolic process [GO:0006163]","pyrimidine nucleotide metabolic process [GO:0006220]","regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0042981]","UTP biosynthetic process [GO:0006228]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["ATP binding [GO:0005524]","metal ion binding [GO:0046872]","nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity [GO:0004550]"]}},"context":{}}

Acts as an atypical E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase by working together with cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes and initiating ubiquitination of CRL substrates: associates with CRL complexes and specifically mediates addition of the first ubiquitin on CRLs targets (PubMed:27565346). The initial ubiquitin is then elongated by CDC34/UBE2R1 and UBE2R2 (PubMed:27565346). E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity is activated upon binding to neddylated cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes (PubMed:24076655, PubMed:27565346). Plays a role in protein translation in response to DNA damage by mediating ubiquitination of EIF4E2, the consequences of EIF4E2 ubiquitination are however unclear (PubMed:25624349). According to a report, EIF4E2 ubiquitination leads to promote EIF4E2 cap-binding and protein translation arrest (PubMed:25624349). According to another report EIF4E2 ubiquitination leads to its subsequent degradation (PubMed:14623119). Acts as the ligase involved in ISGylation of EIF4E2 (PubMed:17289916). In vitro, controls the degradation of the LINC (LInker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex member SUN2 and may therefore have a role in the formation and localization of the LINC complex, and as a consequence, nuclear subcellular localization and nuclear morphology (PubMed:29689197). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14623119, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15236971, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17289916, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21532592, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23707686, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24076655, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25624349, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27565346, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29689197}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Cytoplasm","Disease mutation","Metal-binding","Nucleus","Reference proteome","Repeat","Transferase","Ubl conjugation pathway","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278816, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21590270, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23059369}.

Monoubiquitinates several histones, including histone H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (PubMed:28525742). In response to DNA damage, mediates monoubiquitination of 'Lys-91' of histone H4 (H4K91ub1) (PubMed:19818714). The exact role of H4K91ub1 in DNA damage response is still unclear but it may function as a licensing signal for additional histone H4 post-translational modifications such as H4 'Lys-20' methylation (H4K20me) (PubMed:19818714). PARP1-dependent PARP9-DTX3L-mediated ubiquitination promotes the rapid and specific recruitment of 53BP1/TP53BP1, UIMC1/RAP80, and BRCA1 to DNA damage sites (PubMed:23230272). By monoubiquitinating histone H2B H2BC9/H2BJ and thereby promoting chromatin remodeling, positively regulates STAT1-dependent interferon-stimulated gene transcription and thus STAT1-mediated control of viral replication (PubMed:26479788). Independently of its catalytic activity, promotes the sorting of chemokine receptor CXCR4 from early endosome to lysosome following CXCL12 stimulation by reducing E3 ligase ITCH activity and thus ITCH-mediated ubiquitination of endosomal sorting complex required for transport ESCRT-0 components HGS and STAM (PubMed:24790097). In addition, required for the recruitment of HGS and STAM to early endosomes (PubMed:24790097). In association with PARP9, plays a role in antiviral responses by mediating 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) C3 proteases and thus promoting their proteosomal-mediated degradation (PubMed:26479788). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12670957, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19818714, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23230272, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24790097, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26479788, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28525742}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Antiviral defense","Chromatin regulator","Cytoplasm","DNA damage","DNA repair","Endosome","Host-virus interaction","Immunity","Innate immunity","Lysosome","Membrane","Metal-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Protein transport","Reference proteome","Transferase","Transport","Ubl conjugation","Ubl conjugation pathway","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23230272, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24790097, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26479788}.

Note=Translocates to the nucleus in response to IFNG or IFNB1 stimulation (PubMed:26479788). Localizes at sites of DNA damage in a PARP1-dependent manner (PubMed:23230272). Localization to early endosomes is increased upon CXCL12 stimulation where it co-localizes with ITCH, CXCL4, HGS and STAM (PubMed:24790097). A minor proportion localizes to lysosomes (PubMed:24790097). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23230272, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24790097, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26479788}.","domain":"","geneNames":["DTX3L","BBAP"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","early endosome membrane [GO:0031901]","lysosomal membrane [GO:0005765]","lysosome [GO:0005764]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]","protein-containing complex [GO:0032991]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cellular response to DNA damage stimulus [GO:0006974]","defense response to virus [GO:0051607]","double-strand break repair [GO:0006302]","endosome to lysosome transport [GO:0008333]","histone H2A ubiquitination [GO:0033522]","histone H2B ubiquitination [GO:0033523]","histone monoubiquitination [GO:0010390]","innate immune response [GO:0045087]","negative regulation of ubiquitin-protein transferase activity [GO:0051444]","Notch signaling pathway [GO:0007219]","positive regulation of chromatin binding [GO:0035563]","positive regulation of defense response to virus by host [GO:0002230]","positive regulation of double-strand break repair via nonhomologous end joining [GO:2001034]","positive regulation of NAD+ ADP-ribosyltransferase activity [GO:1901666]","positive regulation of protein binding [GO:0032092]","positive regulation of protein localization to early endosome [GO:1902966]","positive regulation of protein localization to nucleus [GO:1900182]","positive regulation of receptor catabolic process [GO:2000646]","positive regulation of transcription, DNA-templated [GO:0045893]","protein autoubiquitination [GO:0051865]","protein K48-linked ubiquitination [GO:0070936]","protein polyubiquitination [GO:0000209]","protein transport [GO:0015031]","protein ubiquitination [GO:0016567]","ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0006511]","viral process [GO:0016032]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["enzyme activator activity [GO:0008047]","enzyme binding [GO:0019899]","enzyme inhibitor activity [GO:0004857]","histone binding [GO:0042393]","metal ion binding [GO:0046872]","STAT family protein binding [GO:0097677]","ubiquitin-like protein ligase binding [GO:0044389]","ubiquitin protein ligase activity [GO:0061630]","ubiquitin-protein transferase activity [GO:0004842]"]}},"context":{}}

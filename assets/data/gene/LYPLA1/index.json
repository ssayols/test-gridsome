Hydrolyzes fatty acids from S-acylated cysteine residues in proteins such as trimeric G alpha proteins or HRAS (PubMed:20418879). Has depalmitoylating activity toward KCNMA1 (PubMed:22399288). Acts as a lysophospholipase and hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) (PubMed:19439193). Also hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lyso-PE), lysophosphatidylinositol (lyso-PI) and lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) (By similarity). Has much higher thioesterase activity than lysophospholipase activity (PubMed:19439193). Contributes to the production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) during blood coagulation by recognizing and cleaving plasma phospholipids to generate lysophospholipids which in turn act as substrates for ENPP2 to produce LPA (PubMed:21393252). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P70470, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19439193, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20418879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21393252, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22399288}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cell membrane","Cytoplasm","Endoplasmic reticulum","Fatty acid metabolism","Hydrolase","Lipid metabolism","Membrane","Nucleus","Polymorphism","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19439193}.

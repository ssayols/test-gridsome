Generates currents characterized by a linear current-voltage relationship that are sensitive to ruthenium red and gadolinium. Plays a key role in epithelial cell adhesion by maintaining integrin activation through R-Ras recruitment to the ER, most probably in its activated state, and subsequent stimulation of calpain signaling (PubMed:20016066). In the kidney, may contribute to the detection of intraluminal pressure changes and to urine flow sensing. Acts as shear-stress sensor that promotes endothelial cell organization and alignment in the direction of blood flow through calpain activation (PubMed:25119035). Plays a key role in blood vessel formation and vascular structure in both development and adult physiology (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:E2JF22, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20016066, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23479567, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23695678, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25119035}.","keywords":["Cell membrane","Cell projection","Coiled coil","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Disulfide bond","Endoplasmic reticulum","Glycoprotein","Hereditary hemolytic anemia","Ion channel","Ion transport","Membrane","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix","Transport"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20016066}; Multi-pass membrane protein.

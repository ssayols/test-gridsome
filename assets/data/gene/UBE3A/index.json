Several substrates have been identified including the ARNTL/BMAL1, ARC, RAD23A and RAD23B, MCM7 (which is involved in DNA replication), annexin A1, the PML tumor suppressor, and the cell cycle regulator CDKN1B (PubMed:10373495, PubMed:19204938, PubMed:19325566, PubMed:19591933, PubMed:22645313, PubMed:24728990). Additionally, may function as a cellular quality control ubiquitin ligase by helping the degradation of the cytoplasmic misfolded proteins (PubMed:19233847). Finally, UBE3A also promotes its own degradation in vivo. Plays an important role in the regulation of the circadian clock: involved in the ubiquitination of the core clock component ARNTL/BMAL1, leading to its proteasomal degradation (PubMed:24728990). Acts as transcriptional coactivator of progesterone receptor PGR upon progesterone hormone activation (PubMed:16772533). Acts as a regulator of synaptic development by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of ARC (By similarity). Synergizes with WBP2 in enhancing PGR activity (PubMed:16772533). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08759, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10373495, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16772533, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19204938, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19233847, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19325566, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19591933, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22645313, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24273172, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24728990}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Catalyzes the high-risk human papilloma virus E6-mediated ubiquitination of p53/TP53, contributing to the neoplastic progression of cells infected by these viruses. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8380895}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Biological rhythms","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Host-virus interaction","Metal-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Proteasome","Reference proteome","Transferase","Ubl conjugation pathway","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08759}.

GTP-binding protein that does not act as an allosteric activator of the cholera toxin catalytic subunit. Regulates formation of new microtubules and centrosome integrity. Prevents the TBCD-induced microtubule destruction. Participates in association with TBCD, in the disassembly of the apical junction complexes. Antagonizes the effect of TBCD on epithelial cell detachment and tight and adherens junctions disassembly. Together with ARL2, plays a role in the nuclear translocation, retention and transcriptional activity of STAT3. Component of a regulated secretory pathway involved in Ca(2+)-dependent release of acetylcholine. Required for normal progress through the cell cycle. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10831612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16525022, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18234692, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18588884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20740604}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Cell cycle","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","GTP-binding","Isopeptide bond","Lipoprotein","Mitochondrion","Myristate","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion intermembrane space.

Acts as an effector protein of galectin-sensed membrane damage that restricts the proliferation of infecting pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium upon entry into the cytosol by targeting LGALS8-associated bacteria for autophagy (PubMed:22246324). Initially orchestrates bacteria targeting to autophagosomes and subsequently ensures pathogen degradation by regulating pathogen-containing autophagosome maturation (PubMed:23022382, PubMed:25771791). Bacteria targeting to autophagosomes relies on its interaction with MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B and/or GABARAPL2, whereas regulation of pathogen-containing autophagosome maturation requires the interaction with MAP3LC3C (PubMed:23022382, PubMed:25771791). May play a role in ruffle formation and actin cytoskeleton organization and seems to negatively regulate constitutive secretion (PubMed:17635994). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17635994, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22246324, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23022382, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23386746, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25771791}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Autophagy","Coiled coil","Cytoplasm","Cytoplasmic vesicle","Cytoskeleton","Membrane","Metal-binding","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, perinuclear region {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12869526, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17635994, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9230084}.

The APC/C complex acts by mediating ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins: it mainly mediates the formation of 'Lys-11'-linked polyubiquitin chains and, to a lower extent, the formation of 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18485873}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Cell cycle","Cell division","Mitosis","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Repeat","TPR repeat","Ubl conjugation pathway"],"subcellularLocation":"","domain":"","geneNames":["ANAPC5","APC5"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["anaphase-promoting complex [GO:0005680]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["anaphase-promoting complex-dependent catabolic process [GO:0031145]","cell cycle [GO:0007049]","cell division [GO:0051301]","positive regulation of mitotic metaphase/anaphase transition [GO:0045842]","protein K11-linked ubiquitination [GO:0070979]","regulation of mitotic cell cycle phase transition [GO:1901990]","ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0006511]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["protein phosphatase binding [GO:0019903]","ubiquitin protein ligase activity [GO:0061630]"]}},"context":{}}

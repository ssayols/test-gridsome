During cell spreading, plays an important role in cytoskeleton reorganization, focal contacts formation (in the margins but not the central part of spreading cells), and lamellipodial retraction; this function is mechanically antagonized by MYH10. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20052411}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Acetylation","Actin-binding","Alport syndrome","Alternative splicing","Calmodulin-binding","Cataract","Cell adhesion","Cell shape","Coiled coil","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Deafness","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Methylation","Motor protein","Myosin","Non-syndromic deafness","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8VDD5}.

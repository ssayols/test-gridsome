Regulator of T-cell anergy, a phenomenon that occurs when T-cells are rendered unresponsive to antigen rechallenge and no longer respond to their cognate antigen. Acts via its interaction with RNF128/GRAIL, a crucial inductor of CD4 T-cell anergy. Isoform 1 destabilizes RNF128, leading to prevent anergy. In contrast, isoform 2 stabilizes RNF128 and promotes anergy. Surprisingly, it regulates RNF128-mediated ubiquitination, but does not deubiquitinate polyubiquitinated RNF128. Deubiquitinates estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1). Mediates deubiquitination of 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains, but not 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains. Not able to cleave di-ubiquitin. Also capable of removing NEDD8 from NEDD8 conjugates, but with a much lower preference compared to 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitin.; FUNCTION: Plays a key non-catalytic role in DNA repair regulation by inhibiting activity of RNF168, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that promotes accumulation of 'Lys-63'-linked histone H2A and H2AX at DNA damage sites. Inhibits RNF168 independently of ubiquitin thioesterase activity by binding and inhibiting UBE2N/UBC13, the E2 partner of RNF168, thereby limiting spreading of 'Lys-63'-linked histone H2A and H2AX marks. Inhibition occurs by binding to free ubiquitin: free ubiquitin acts as an allosteric regulator that increases affinity for UBE2N/UBC13 and disrupts interaction with UBE2V1. The OTUB1-UBE2N/UBC13-free ubiquitin complex adopts a configuration that mimics a cleaved 'Lys48'-linked di-ubiquitin chain.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Adaptive immunity","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","DNA damage","DNA repair","Direct protein sequencing","Hydrolase","Immunity","Phosphoprotein","Protease","Reference proteome","Thiol protease","Ubl conjugation pathway"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250}.","domain":"DOMAIN 80..271;  /note=\"OTU\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00139\"","geneNames":["OTUB1","OTB1","OTU1","HSPC263"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["adaptive immune response [GO:0002250]","cellular response to DNA damage stimulus [GO:0006974]","cellular response to interleukin-1 [GO:0071347]","DNA repair [GO:0006281]","negative regulation of double-strand break repair [GO:2000780]","negative regulation of histone H2A K63-linked ubiquitination [GO:1901315]","protein deubiquitination [GO:0016579]","protein K48-linked deubiquitination [GO:0071108]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["NEDD8-specific protease activity [GO:0019784]","thiol-dependent ubiquitin-specific protease activity [GO:0004843]","ubiquitin binding [GO:0043130]","ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]"]}},"context":{}}

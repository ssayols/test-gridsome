Predominantly acts as a RNA-binding protein: binds preferentially to the 5'-[CU]CUGCG-3' RNA motif and specifically recognizes mRNA transcripts modified by C5-methylcytosine (m5C) (PubMed:19561594, PubMed:31358969). Promotes mRNA stabilization: acts by binding to m5C-containing mRNAs and recruiting the mRNA stability maintainer ELAVL1, thereby preventing mRNA decay (PubMed:10817758, PubMed:11698476, PubMed:31358969). Component of the CRD-mediated complex that promotes MYC mRNA stability (PubMed:19029303). Contributes to the regulation of translation by modulating the interaction between the mRNA and eukaryotic initiation factors (By similarity). Plays a key role in RNA composition of extracellular exosomes by defining the sorting of small non-coding RNAs, such as tRNAs, Y RNAs, Vault RNAs and miRNAs (PubMed:27559612, PubMed:29073095). Probably sorts RNAs in exosomes by recognizing and binding C5-methylcytosine (m5C)-containing RNAs (PubMed:28341602, PubMed:29073095). Acts as a key effector of epidermal progenitors by preventing epidermal progenitor senescence: acts by regulating the translation of a senescence-associated subset of cytokine mRNAs, possibly by binding to m5C-containing mRNAs (PubMed:29712925). Also involved in pre-mRNA alternative splicing regulation: binds to splice sites in pre-mRNA and regulates splice site selection (PubMed:12604611). Also able to bind DNA: regulates transcription of the multidrug resistance gene MDR1 is enhanced in presence of the APEX1 acetylated form at 'Lys-6' and 'Lys-7' (PubMed:18809583). Binds to promoters that contain a Y-box (5'-CTGATTGGCCAA-3'), such as MDR1 and HLA class II genes (PubMed:8188694, PubMed:18809583). Promotes separation of DNA strands that contain mismatches or are modified by cisplatin (PubMed:14718551). Has endonucleolytic activity and can introduce nicks or breaks into double-stranded DNA, suggesting a role in DNA repair (PubMed:14718551). The secreted form acts as an extracellular mitogen and stimulates cell migration and proliferation (PubMed:19483673). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q28618, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10817758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11698476, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12604611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14718551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18809583, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19029303, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19483673, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19561594, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27559612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28341602, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29073095, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29712925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31358969, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8188694}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Activator","Cytoplasm","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Isopeptide bond","Mitogen","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Repressor","Secreted","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Ubl conjugation","mRNA processing","mRNA splicing"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12604611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14718551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15806160}.

Participates in the uronate cycle of glucose metabolism. May play a role in the water absorption and cellular osmoregulation in the proximal renal tubules by producing xylitol, an osmolyte, thereby preventing osmolytic stress from occurring in the renal tubules.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Carbohydrate metabolism","Direct protein sequencing","Glucose metabolism","Membrane","Methylation","NADP","Oxidoreductase","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Xylose metabolism"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane {ECO:0000250}; Peripheral membrane protein {ECO:0000250}.

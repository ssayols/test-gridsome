Promotes the catalytic efficiency of SLC1A1/EAAC1 probably by reducing its interaction with ARL6IP5, a negative regulator of SLC1A1/EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport (By similarity). Plays a role in the formation and stabilization of endoplasmic reticulum tubules (PubMed:24262037). Negatively regulates apoptosis, possibly by modulating the activity of caspase-9 (CASP9). Inhibits cleavage of CASP9-dependent substrates and downstream markers of apoptosis but not CASP9 itself (PubMed:12754298). May be involved in protein transport, membrane trafficking, or cell signaling during hematopoietic maturation (PubMed:10995579). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9JKW0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12754298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24262037, ECO:0000303|PubMed:10995579}.","keywords":["Alternative splicing","Apoptosis","Disease mutation","Endoplasmic reticulum","Hereditary spastic paraplegia","Membrane","Neurodegeneration","Reference proteome","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endomembrane system {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10995579}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10995579}.

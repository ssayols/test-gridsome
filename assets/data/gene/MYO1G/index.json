Unconventional myosins are actin-based motor molecules with ATPase activity and serve in intracellular movements. Acts as a regulator of T-cell migration by generating membrane tension, enforcing cell-intrinsic meandering search, thereby enhancing detection of rare antigens during lymph-node surveillance, enabling pathogen eradication. Also required in B-cells, where it regulates different membrane/cytoskeleton-dependent processes. Involved in Fc-gamma receptor (Fc-gamma-R) phagocytosis. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q5SUA5}.; FUNCTION: [Minor histocompatibility antigen HA-2]: Constitutes the minor histocompatibility antigen HA-2. More generally, minor histocompatibility antigens (mHags) refer to immunogenic peptide which, when complexed with MHC, can generate an immune response after recognition by specific T-cells. The peptides are derived from polymorphic intracellular proteins, which are cleaved by normal pathways of antigen processing. The binding of these peptides to MHC class I or class II molecules and their expression on the cell surface can stimulate T-cell responses and thereby trigger graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from HLA-identical sibling donor. GVHD is a frequent complication after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), due to mismatch of minor histocompatibility antigen in HLA-matched sibling marrow transplants. HA-2 is restricted to MHC class I HLA-A*0201. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11544309, ECO:0000305}.","keywords":["ATP-binding","Acetylation","Actin-binding","Adaptive immunity","Alternative splicing","Calmodulin-binding","Cell membrane","Cell projection","Direct protein sequencing","Immunity","Lipid-binding","Membrane","Motor protein","Myosin","Nucleotide-binding","Polymorphism","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19968988, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20071333}; Peripheral membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19968988, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20071333}.

In T-cells, transiently accumulates in discrete areas at the plasma membrane of migrating cells or when membranes are deformed (By similarity). Localization at the membrane is not highly dependent on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels. Released from the membrane in the presence of ATP. May be enriched in peripheral processes, such as microvilli or ruffles. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q5SUA5, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20071333}.","domain":"DOMAIN 9..707;  /note=\"Myosin motor\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00782\"; DOMAIN 710..739;  /note=\"IQ\"; DOMAIN 824..1017;  /note=\"TH1\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU01093\"","geneNames":["MYO1G","HA2"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["actin cytoskeleton [GO:0015629]","cell [GO:0005623]","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","filopodium [GO:0030175]","lamellipodium [GO:0030027]","leading edge membrane [GO:0031256]","membrane [GO:0016020]","microvillus [GO:0005902]","myosin complex [GO:0016459]","phagocytic cup [GO:0001891]","plasma membrane [GO:0005886]","vesicle [GO:0031982]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["actin filament organization [GO:0007015]","cell gliding [GO:0071976]","cell-substrate adhesion [GO:0031589]","exocytosis [GO:0006887]","Fc-gamma receptor signaling pathway involved in phagocytosis [GO:0038096]","T cell meandering migration [GO:0120117]","T cell mediated immunity [GO:0002456]","T cell migration [GO:0072678]","vesicle transport along actin filament [GO:0030050]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["actin-dependent ATPase activity [GO:0030898]","actin filament binding [GO:0051015]","ATP binding [GO:0005524]","calmodulin binding [GO:0005516]","microfilament motor activity [GO:0000146]","phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate binding [GO:0005547]","phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate binding [GO:0043325]","phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding [GO:0005546]"]}},"context":{}}

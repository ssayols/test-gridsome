The TRiC complex mediates the folding of WRAP53/TCAB1, thereby regulating telomere maintenance (PubMed:25467444). As part of the TRiC complex may play a role in the assembly of BBSome, a complex involved in ciliogenesis regulating transports vesicles to the cilia (PubMed:20080638). The TRiC complex plays a role in the folding of actin and tubulin (Probable). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20080638, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25467444, ECO:0000305}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Chaperone","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Isopeptide bond","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20080638}.","domain":"","geneNames":["CCT2","99D8.1","CCTB"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["azurophil granule lumen [GO:0035578]","cell body [GO:0044297]","chaperonin-containing T-complex [GO:0005832]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","extracellular region [GO:0005576]","microtubule [GO:0005874]","zona pellucida receptor complex [GO:0002199]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["binding of sperm to zona pellucida [GO:0007339]","chaperone-mediated protein complex assembly [GO:0051131]","chaperone mediated protein folding independent of cofactor [GO:0051086]","neutrophil degranulation [GO:0043312]","positive regulation of establishment of protein localization to telomere [GO:1904851]","positive regulation of protein localization to Cajal body [GO:1904871]","positive regulation of telomerase activity [GO:0051973]","positive regulation of telomerase RNA localization to Cajal body [GO:1904874]","positive regulation of telomere maintenance via telomerase [GO:0032212]","protein folding [GO:0006457]","protein stabilization [GO:0050821]","scaRNA localization to Cajal body [GO:0090666]","toxin transport [GO:1901998]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["ATP binding [GO:0005524]","protein folding chaperone [GO:0044183]","ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]","unfolded protein binding [GO:0051082]"]}},"context":{}}

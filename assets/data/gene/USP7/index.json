Together with DAXX, prevents MDM2 self-ubiquitination and enhances the E3 ligase activity of MDM2 towards p53/TP53, thereby promoting p53/TP53 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (PubMed:15053880, PubMed:16845383, PubMed:18566590, PubMed:20153724). Deubiquitinates p53/TP53, preventing degradation of p53/TP53, and enhances p53/TP53-dependent transcription regulation, cell growth repression and apoptosis (PubMed:25283148). Deubiquitinates p53/TP53 and MDM2 and strongly stabilizes p53/TP53 even in the presence of excess MDM2, and also induces p53/TP53-dependent cell growth repression and apoptosis (PubMed:11923872). Deubiquitination of FOXO4 in presence of hydrogen peroxide is not dependent on p53/TP53 and inhibits FOXO4-induced transcriptional activity (PubMed:16964248). In association with DAXX, is involved in the deubiquitination and translocation of PTEN from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, both processes that are counteracted by PML (PubMed:18716620). Deubiquitinates KMT2E/MLL5 preventing KMT2E/MLL5 proteasomal-mediated degradation (PubMed:26678539). Involved in cell proliferation during early embryonic development. Involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) in response to UV damage: recruited to DNA damage sites following interaction with KIAA1530/UVSSA and promotes deubiquitination of ERCC6, preventing UV-induced degradation of ERCC6 (PubMed:22466611, PubMed:22466612). Involved in maintenance of DNA methylation via its interaction with UHRF1 and DNMT1: acts by mediating deubiquitination of UHRF1 and DNMT1, preventing their degradation and promoting DNA methylation by DNMT1 (PubMed:21745816, PubMed:22411829). Deubiquitinates alkylation repair enzyme ALKBH3. OTUD4 recruits USP7 and USP9X to stabilize ALKBH3, thereby promoting the repair of alkylated DNA lesions (PubMed:25944111). Acts as a chromatin regulator via its association with the Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-like complex; may act by deubiquitinating components of the PRC1-like complex (PubMed:20601937). Able to mediate deubiquitination of histone H2B; it is however unsure whether this activity takes place in vivo (PubMed:20601937). Exhibits a preference towards 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitin chains (PubMed:22689415). Increases regulatory T-cells (Treg) suppressive capacity by deubiquitinating and stabilizing the transcription factor FOXP3 which is crucial for Treg cell function (PubMed:23973222). Plays a role in the maintenance of the circadian clock periodicity via deubiquitination and stabilization of the CRY1 and CRY2 proteins (PubMed:27123980). Deubiquitinates REST, thereby stabilizing REST and promoting the maintenance of neural progenitor cells (PubMed:21258371). Deubiquitinates SIRT7, inhibiting SIRT7 histone deacetylase activity and regulating gluconeogenesis (PubMed:28655758). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11923872, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15053880, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16845383, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16964248, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18566590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18716620, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20153724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20601937, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21258371, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21745816, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22411829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22466611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22466612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22689415, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23973222, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25283148, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25944111, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26678539, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27123980, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28655758}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Contributes to the overall stabilization and trans-activation capability of the herpesvirus 1 trans-acting transcriptional protein ICP0/VMW110 during HSV-1 infection. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14506283, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16160161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18590780}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Biological rhythms","Chromosome","Cytoplasm","DNA damage","DNA repair","Developmental protein","Direct protein sequencing","Host-virus interaction","Hydrolase","Isopeptide bond","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Protease","Reference proteome","Thiol protease","Ubl conjugation","Ubl conjugation pathway"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21258371, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23973222, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25283148, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26678539}.

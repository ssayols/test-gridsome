During this step, the ribosome changes from the pre-translocational (PRE) to the post-translocational (POST) state as the newly formed A-site-bound peptidyl-tRNA and P-site-bound deacylated tRNA move to the P and E sites, respectively. Catalyzes the coordinated movement of the two tRNA molecules, the mRNA and conformational changes in the ribosome.","keywords":["3D-structure","ADP-ribosylation","Acetylation","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Elongation factor","GTP-binding","Isopeptide bond","Methylation","Neurodegeneration","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Protein biosynthesis","Reference proteome","Spinocerebellar ataxia","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25064856}.

Necessary for the fragmentation of Golgi stacks during mitosis and for VCP-mediated reassembly of Golgi stacks after mitosis (By similarity). May play a role in VCP-mediated formation of transitional endoplasmic reticulum (tER) (By similarity). Inhibits the activity of CTSL (in vitro) (PubMed:15498563). Together with UBXN2B/p37, regulates the centrosomal levels of kinase AURKA/Aurora A during mitotic progression by promoting AURKA removal from centrosomes in prophase (PubMed:23649807). Also, regulates spindle orientation during mitosis (PubMed:23649807). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O35987, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15498563, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23649807}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Chromosome","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Direct protein sequencing","Golgi apparatus","Lipid-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O35987}.

In response to KITLG/SCF binding, KIT can activate several signaling pathways. Phosphorylates PIK3R1, PLCG1, SH2B2/APS and CBL. Activates the AKT1 signaling pathway by phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Activated KIT also transmits signals via GRB2 and activation of RAS, RAF1 and the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and/or MAPK3/ERK1. Promotes activation of STAT family members STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A and STAT5B. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. KIT signaling is modulated by protein phosphatases, and by rapid internalization and degradation of the receptor. Activated KIT promotes phosphorylation of the protein phosphatases PTPN6/SHP-1 and PTPRU, and of the transcription factors STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A and STAT5B. Promotes phosphorylation of PIK3R1, CBL, CRK (isoform Crk-II), LYN, MAPK1/ERK2 and/or MAPK3/ERK1, PLCG1, SRC and SHC1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10397721, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12444928, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12511554, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12878163, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17904548, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19265199, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21135090, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21640708, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7520444, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9528781}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Alternative splicing","Cell membrane","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Disulfide bond","Glycoprotein","Immunoglobulin domain","Kinase","Magnesium","Membrane","Metal-binding","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Proto-oncogene","Receptor","Reference proteome","Repeat","Signal","Transferase","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix","Tyrosine-protein kinase","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: [Isoform 1]: Cell membrane; Single-pass type I membrane protein.; SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: [Isoform 2]: Cell membrane; Single-pass type I membrane protein.; SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: [Isoform 3]: Cytoplasm.

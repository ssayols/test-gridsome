Also produces diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A), a universal pleiotropic signaling molecule needed for cell regulation pathways, by direct condensation of 2 ATPs. Thereby, may play a special role in Ap4A homeostasis (PubMed:19710017). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17544401, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19710017, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24898252, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28675565}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Acetylation","Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase","Cell projection","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease","Cytoplasm","Disease mutation","Hydrolase","Ligase","Mitochondrion","Neurodegeneration","Neuropathy","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Protein biosynthesis","Reference proteome","Secreted","Transferase"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17035524}.

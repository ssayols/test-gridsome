In contrast, it is excluded from chromatin when 'Tyr-41' of histone H3 is phosphorylated (H3Y41ph). Can interact with lamin-B receptor (LBR). This interaction can contribute to the association of the heterochromatin with the inner nuclear membrane. Involved in the formation of functional kinetochore through interaction with MIS12 complex proteins. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19783980}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Centromere","Chromosome","Direct protein sequencing","Host-virus interaction","Isopeptide bond","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Repeat","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10460410, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19617346}.

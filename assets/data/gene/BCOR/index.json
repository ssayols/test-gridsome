May specifically inhibit gene expression when recruited to promoter regions by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins such as BCL6 and MLLT3. This repression may be mediated at least in part by histone deacetylase activities which can associate with this corepressor. Involved in the repression of TFAP2A; impairs binding of BCL6 and KDM2B to TFAP2A promoter regions. Via repression of TFAP2A acts as a negative regulator of osteo-dentiogenic capacity in adult stem cells; the function implies inhibition of methylation on histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me3) and 'Lys-36' (H3K36me2). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10898795, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15004558, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18280243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19578371, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23911289}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ANK repeat","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Chromatin regulator","Disease mutation","Isopeptide bond","Microphthalmia","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Repeat","Repressor","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10898795}.","domain":"","geneNames":["BCOR","KIAA1575"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["BCOR complex [GO:0140261]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["blastocyst hatching [GO:0001835]","heart development [GO:0007507]","histone H2A monoubiquitination [GO:0035518]","negative regulation of bone mineralization [GO:0030502]","negative regulation of histone H3-K36 methylation [GO:0000415]","negative regulation of histone H3-K4 methylation [GO:0051572]","negative regulation of tooth mineralization [GO:0070171]","negative regulation of transcription, DNA-templated [GO:0045892]","negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]","odontogenesis [GO:0042476]","roof of mouth development [GO:0060021]","specification of axis polarity [GO:0065001]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["heat shock protein binding [GO:0031072]","histone deacetylase binding [GO:0042826]","RNA polymerase II regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0000977]","transcription corepressor activity [GO:0003714]","transcription factor binding [GO:0008134]","transcription regulatory region DNA binding [GO:0044212]"]}},"context":{}}

May function together with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBE2D1/UBCH5A and UBE2D2/UBC4. Mediates ubiquitination of PXN/paxillin and Salmonella type III secreted protein sopA. May be involved in regulation of cell motility and localization of PXN/paxillin. Mediates the 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of JKAMP thereby regulating JKAMP function by decreasing its association with components of the proteasome and ERAD; the ubiquitination appears to involve E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2N. Mediates the 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination of STING1 at 'Lys-150' leading to its proteasomal degradation; the ubiquitination occurs in mitochondria after viral transfection and regulates antiviral responses. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11329381, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12861019, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16176924, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19269966, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19285439}.","keywords":["Acetylation","Endoplasmic reticulum","Membrane","Metal-binding","Mitochondrion","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Transferase","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix","Ubl conjugation pathway","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; Multi-pass membrane protein.

Requires a 3'-single-stranded tail as entry site for acid nuclei unwinding activities as well as the binding and hydrolyzing of any of the four ribo- or deoxyribo-nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) (PubMed:1537828). Unwinds numerous nucleic acid substrates such as double-stranded (ds) DNA and RNA, DNA:RNA hybrids, DNA and RNA forks composed of either partially complementary DNA duplexes or DNA:RNA hybrids, respectively, and also DNA and RNA displacement loops (D- and R-loops), triplex-helical DNA (H-DNA) structure and DNA and RNA-based G-quadruplexes (PubMed:20669935, PubMed:21561811, PubMed:24049074). Binds dsDNA, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), dsRNA, ssRNA and poly(A)-containing RNA (PubMed:9111062, PubMed:10198287). Binds also to circular dsDNA or dsRNA of either linear and/or circular forms and stimulates the relaxation of supercoiled DNAs catalyzed by topoisomerase TOP2A (PubMed:12711669). Plays a role in DNA replication at origins of replication and cell cycle progression (PubMed:24990949). Plays a role as a transcriptional coactivator acting as a bridging factor between polymerase II holoenzyme and transcription factors or cofactors, such as BRCA1, CREBBP, RELA and SMN1 (PubMed:11149922, PubMed:9323138, PubMed:9662397, PubMed:11038348, PubMed:11416126, PubMed:15355351, PubMed:28221134). Binds to the CDKN2A promoter (PubMed:11038348). Plays several roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression (PubMed:28221134, PubMed:28355180). In cooperation with NUP98, promotes pre-mRNA alternative splicing activities of a subset of genes (PubMed:11402034, PubMed:16680162, PubMed:28221134, PubMed:28355180). As component of a large PER complex, is involved in the negative regulation of 3' transcriptional termination of circadian target genes such as PER1 and NR1D1 and the control of the circadian rhythms (By similarity). Acts also as a nuclear resolvase that is able to bind and neutralize harmful massive secondary double-stranded RNA structures formed by inverted-repeat Alu retrotransposon elements that are inserted and transcribed as parts of genes during the process of gene transposition (PubMed:28355180). Involved in the positive regulation of nuclear export of constitutive transport element (CTE)-containing unspliced mRNA (PubMed:9162007, PubMed:10924507, PubMed:11402034). Component of the coding region determinant (CRD)-mediated complex that promotes cytoplasmic MYC mRNA stability (PubMed:19029303). Plays a role in mRNA translation (PubMed:28355180). Positively regulates translation of selected mRNAs through its binding to post-transcriptional control element (PCE) in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) (PubMed:16680162). Involved with LARP6 in the translation stimulation of type I collagen mRNAs for CO1A1 and CO1A2 through binding of a specific stem-loop structure in their 5'-UTRs (PubMed:22190748). Stimulates LIN28A-dependent mRNA translation probably by facilitating ribonucleoprotein remodeling during the process of translation (PubMed:21247876). Plays also a role as a small interfering (siRNA)-loading factor involved in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading complex (RLC) assembly, and hence functions in the RISC-mediated gene silencing process (PubMed:17531811). Binds preferentially to short double-stranded RNA, such as those produced during rotavirus intestinal infection (PubMed:28636595). This interaction may mediate NLRP9 inflammasome activation and trigger inflammatory response, including IL18 release and pyroptosis (PubMed:28636595). Finally, mediates the attachment of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) to actin filaments in the nucleus (PubMed:11687588). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O70133, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10198287, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10924507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11038348, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11149922, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11402034, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11416126, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11687588, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12711669, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15355351, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1537828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16680162, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17531811, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19029303, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20669935, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21247876, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21561811, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22190748, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24049074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24990949, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25062910, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28221134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28355180, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28636595, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9111062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9162007, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9323138, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9662397}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Plays a role in HIV-1 replication and virion infectivity (PubMed:11096080, PubMed:19229320, PubMed:25149208, PubMed:27107641). Enhances HIV-1 transcription by facilitating the binding of RNA polymerase II holoenzyme to the proviral DNA (PubMed:11096080, PubMed:25149208).

Positively regulates HIV-1 gag mRNA translation, through its binding to post-transcriptional control element (PCE) in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) (PubMed:16680162). Binds (via DRBM domains) to a HIV-1 double-stranded RNA region of the primer binding site (PBS)-segment of the 5'-UTR, and hence stimulates DHX9 incorporation into virions and virion infectivity (PubMed:27107641). Plays also a role as a cytosolic viral MyD88-dependent DNA and RNA sensors in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and hence induce antiviral innate immune responses (PubMed:20696886, PubMed:21957149).

The Arp2/3 complex mediates the formation of branched actin networks in the cytoplasm, providing the force for cell motility (PubMed:9000076). Seems to contact the pointed end of the daughter actin filament (PubMed:9000076). In podocytes, required for the formation of lamellipodia downstream of AVIL and PLCE1 regulation (PubMed:29058690). In addition to its role in the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton, the Arp2/3 complex also promotes actin polymerization in the nucleus, thereby regulating gene transcription and repair of damaged DNA (PubMed:17220302, PubMed:29925947). The Arp2/3 complex promotes homologous recombination (HR) repair in response to DNA damage by promoting nuclear actin polymerization, leading to drive motility of double-strand breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:29925947). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17220302, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29058690, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29925947, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9000076}.","keywords":["ATP-binding","Acetylation","Actin-binding","Alternative splicing","Cell projection","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Direct protein sequencing","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9000076}.

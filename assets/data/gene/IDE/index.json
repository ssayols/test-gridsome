Substrate binding induces important conformation changes, making it possible to bind and degrade larger substrates, such as insulin (PubMed:23922390, PubMed:26394692, PubMed:29596046). Contributes to the regulation of peptide hormone signaling cascades and regulation of blood glucose homeostasis via its role in the degradation of insulin, glucagon and IAPP (By similarity). Plays a role in the degradation and clearance of APP-derived amyloidogenic peptides that are secreted by neurons and microglia (PubMed:9830016, PubMed:26394692) (Probable). Involved in antigen processing. Produces both the N terminus and the C terminus of MAGEA3-derived antigenic peptide (EVDPIGHLY) that is presented to cytotoxic T lymphocytes by MHC class I. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9JHR7, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10684867, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17051221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17613531, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18986166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19321446, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20364150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2293021, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23922390, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24847884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26394692, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26968463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29596046, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9830016, ECO:0000305|PubMed:23922390}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) The membrane-associated isoform acts as an entry receptor for varicella-zoster virus (VZV). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17055432, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17553876}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Allosteric enzyme","Alternative splicing","Cell membrane","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Host cell receptor for virus entry","Host-virus interaction","Hydrolase","Membrane","Metal-binding","Metalloprotease","Nucleotide-binding","Protease","Receptor","Reference proteome","Secreted","Zinc"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20364150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9830016}.

Mediates the saturable, pH-sensitive and electrogenic cotransport of neutral amino acids and sodium ions with a stoichiometry of 1:1. May function in the transport of amino acids at the blood-brain barrier and in the supply of maternal nutrients to the fetus through the placenta. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10930503, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15922329}.","keywords":["Alternative splicing","Amino-acid transport","Cell membrane","Disulfide bond","Glycoprotein","Ion transport","Membrane","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Sodium","Sodium transport","Symport","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix","Transport","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15561425, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16616430}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15561425, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16616430}.

Specifically binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(P3)). Also can bind phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(P4)), phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns(P5)) and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) (By similarity). Plays a role in protein transport between cellular compartments. Together with RAB7A facilitates endosome membrane association of the retromer cargo-selective subcomplex (CSC/VPS). May in part act as component of the SNX3-retromer complex which mediates the retrograde endosome-to-TGN transport of WLS distinct from the SNX-BAR retromer pathway (PubMed:21725319, PubMed:24344282). Promotes stability and cell surface expression of epithelial sodium channel (ENAC) subunits SCNN1A and SCNN1G (By similarity). Not involved in EGFR degradation. Involved in the regulation of phagocytosis in dendritic cells possibly by regulating EEA1 recruitment to the nascent phagosomes (PubMed:23237080). Involved in iron homeostasis through regulation of endocytic recycling of the transferrin receptor TFRC presumably by delivering the transferrin:transferrin receptor complex to recycling endosomes; the function may involve the CSC retromer subcomplex (By similarity). In the case of Salmonella enterica infection plays arole in maturation of the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) and promotes recruitment of LAMP1 to SCVs (PubMed:20482551). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O70492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11433298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18767904, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21725319, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23237080, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24344282, ECO:0000305|PubMed:21725319}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Chromosomal rearrangement","Cytoplasmic vesicle","Direct protein sequencing","Endosome","Isopeptide bond","Lipid-binding","Methylation","Microphthalmia","Phosphoprotein","Protein transport","Reference proteome","Transport","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Early endosome {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11433298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21725319}.

Note=Colocalizes to clathrin-coated endosomal vesicles morphologically distinct from retromer-decorated non-branched endosomal tubule structures (PubMed:21725319) Colocalizes with EEA1 on nascent phagosomes in dendritic cells but competes with EEA1 for binding to phagosomal membrane (PubMed:23237080). In the case of Salmonella enterica infection localizes to Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCVs) from which SNX3-containing tubules form 30-60 min after infection (PubMed:20482551). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20482551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21725319, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23237080}.","domain":"DOMAIN 27..151;  /note=\"PX\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00147\"","geneNames":["SNX3"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["clathrin-coated vesicle [GO:0030136]","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","early endosome [GO:0005769]","early endosome membrane [GO:0031901]","early phagosome [GO:0032009]","endosome membrane [GO:0010008]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["endocytic recycling [GO:0032456]","intralumenal vesicle formation [GO:0070676]","late endosome to Golgi transport [GO:0034499]","membrane invagination [GO:0010324]","negative regulation of early endosome to late endosome transport [GO:2000642]","negative regulation of phagocytosis [GO:0050765]","negative regulation of protein catabolic process [GO:0042177]","negative regulation of protein transport [GO:0051224]","negative regulation of viral entry into host cell [GO:0046597]","positive regulation of neuron projection development [GO:0010976]","protein deubiquitination [GO:0016579]","protein to membrane docking [GO:0022615]","protein transport [GO:0015031]","regulation of intracellular protein transport [GO:0033157]","regulation of Wnt signaling pathway [GO:0030111]","response to bacterium [GO:0009617]","Wnt signaling pathway [GO:0016055]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate binding [GO:0080025]","phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate binding [GO:0032266]","phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate binding [GO:0070273]","phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate binding [GO:0010314]","protein phosphatase binding [GO:0019903]"]}},"context":{}}

The active ATPase sites in the MCM2-7 ring are formed through the interaction surfaces of two neighboring subunits such that a critical structure of a conserved arginine finger motif is provided in trans relative to the ATP-binding site of the Walker A box of the adjacent subunit. The six ATPase active sites, however, are likely to contribute differentially to the complex helicase activity. Required for S-phase checkpoint activation upon UV-induced damage. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15210935, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15538388, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9305914}.","keywords":["ATP-binding","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cell cycle","DNA replication","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Glycoprotein","Helicase","Hydrolase","Isopeptide bond","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000250}.","domain":"DOMAIN 332..538;  /note=\"MCM\"","geneNames":["MCM7","CDC47","MCM2"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["chromatin [GO:0000785]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","MCM complex [GO:0042555]","membrane [GO:0016020]","nuclear chromosome, telomeric region [GO:0000784]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cell population proliferation [GO:0008283]","cellular response to DNA damage stimulus [GO:0006974]","cellular response to epidermal growth factor stimulus [GO:0071364]","cellular response to xenobiotic stimulus [GO:0071466]","DNA replication [GO:0006260]","DNA replication initiation [GO:0006270]","DNA strand elongation involved in DNA replication [GO:0006271]","DNA unwinding involved in DNA replication [GO:0006268]","double-strand break repair via break-induced replication [GO:0000727]","G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0000082]","pre-replicative complex assembly involved in nuclear cell cycle DNA replication [GO:0006267]","regulation of phosphorylation [GO:0042325]","response to drug [GO:0042493]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["ATP binding [GO:0005524]","DNA helicase activity [GO:0003678]","DNA replication origin binding [GO:0003688]","single-stranded DNA binding [GO:0003697]"]}},"context":{}}

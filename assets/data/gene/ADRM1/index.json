This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair. Within the complex, functions as a proteasomal ubiquitin receptor. Engages and activates 19S-associated deubiquitinases UCHL5 and PSMD14 during protein degradation. UCHL5 reversibly associate with the 19S regulatory particle whereas PSMD14 is an intrinsic subunit of the proteasome lid subcomplex. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16815440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16906146, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16990800, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17139257, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18497817, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24752541, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25702870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25702872}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Cytoplasm","Isopeptide bond","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Proteasome","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16990800}.

Mainly associated with cytoskeleton organization, in active state binds to a variety of effector proteins to regulate cellular responses such as cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration and cell cycle. Regulates a signal transduction pathway linking plasma membrane receptors to the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers (PubMed:8910519, PubMed:9121475, PubMed:31570889). Involved in a microtubule-dependent signal that is required for the myosin contractile ring formation during cell cycle cytokinesis (PubMed:16236794, PubMed:12900402). Plays an essential role in cleavage furrow formation. Required for the apical junction formation of keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion (PubMed:20974804, PubMed:23940119). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). The MEMO1-RHOA-DIAPH1 signaling pathway plays an important role in ERBB2-dependent stabilization of microtubules at the cell cortex. It controls the localization of APC and CLASP2 to the cell membrane, via the regulation of GSK3B activity. In turn, membrane-bound APC allows the localization of the MACF1 to the cell membrane, which is required for microtubule capture and stabilization (PubMed:20937854). Regulates KCNA2 potassium channel activity by reducing its location at the cell surface in response to CHRM1 activation; promotes KCNA2 endocytosis (PubMed:9635436, PubMed:19403695). Acts as an allosteric activator of guanine nucleotide exchange factor ECT2 by binding in its activated GTP-bound form to the PH domain of ECT2 which stimulates the release of PH inhibition and promotes the binding of substrate RHOA to the ECT2 catalytic center (PubMed:31888991). May be an activator of PLCE1 (PubMed:16103226). In neurons, involved in the inhibiton of the initial spine growth. Upon activation by CaMKII, modulates dendritic spine structural plasticity by relaying CaMKII transient activation to synapse-specific, long-term signaling (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P61589, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12900402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16103226, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16236794, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19403695, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19934221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20937854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20974804, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23940119, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31570889, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31888991, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8910519, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9121475, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9635436}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Serves as a target for the yopT cysteine peptidase from Yersinia pestis, vector of the plague. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12062101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12538863}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ADP-ribosylation","Cell cycle","Cell division","Cell membrane","Cell projection","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Ectodermal dysplasia","GTP-binding","Glycoprotein","Host-virus interaction","Hydrolase","Lipoprotein","Magnesium","Membrane","Methylation","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Prenylation","Proto-oncogene","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; Lipid-anchor; Cytoplasmic side.

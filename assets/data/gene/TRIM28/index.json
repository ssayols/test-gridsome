Mediates gene silencing by recruiting CHD3, a subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex, and SETDB1 (which specifically methylates histone H3 at 'Lys-9' (H3K9me)) to the promoter regions of KRAB target genes. Enhances transcriptional repression by coordinating the increase in H3K9me, the decrease in histone H3 'Lys-9 and 'Lys-14' acetylation (H3K9ac and H3K14ac, respectively) and the disposition of HP1 proteins to silence gene expression. Recruitment of SETDB1 induces heterochromatinization. May play a role as a coactivator for CEBPB and NR3C1 in the transcriptional activation of ORM1. Also corepressor for ERBB4. Inhibits E2F1 activity by stimulating E2F1-HDAC1 complex formation and inhibiting E2F1 acetylation. May serve as a partial backup to prevent E2F1-mediated apoptosis in the absence of RB1. Important regulator of CDKN1A/p21(CIP1). Has E3 SUMO-protein ligase activity toward itself via its PHD-type zinc finger. Also specifically sumoylates IRF7, thereby inhibiting its transactivation activity. Ubiquitinates p53/TP53 leading to its proteosomal degradation; the function is enhanced by MAGEC2 and MAGEA2, and possibly MAGEA3 and MAGEA6. Mediates the nuclear localization of KOX1, ZNF268 and ZNF300 transcription factors. In association with isoform 2 of ZFP90, is required for the transcriptional repressor activity of FOXP3 and the suppressive function of regulatory T-cells (Treg) (PubMed:23543754). Probably forms a corepressor complex required for activated KRAS-mediated promoter hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) or other tumor-related genes in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (PubMed:24623306). Required to maintain a transcriptionally repressive state of genes in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (PubMed:24623306). In ESCs, in collaboration with SETDB1, is also required for H3K9me3 and silencing of endogenous and introduced retroviruses in a DNA-methylation independent-pathway (By similarity). Associates at promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) leading to their gene silencing (PubMed:24623306). The SETDB1-TRIM28-ZNF274 complex may play a role in recruiting ATRX to the 3'-exons of zinc-finger coding genes with atypical chromatin signatures to establish or maintain/protect H3K9me3 at these transcriptionally active regions (PubMed:27029610). Acts as a corepressor for ZFP568 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q62318, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10347202, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11959841, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15882967, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16107876, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16862143, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17079232, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17178852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17704056, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17942393, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18060868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18082607, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20424263, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20858735, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20864041, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21940674, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23543754, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23665872, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24623306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27029610, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8769649, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9016654}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Plays a critical role in the shutdown of lytic gene expression during the early stage of herpes virus 8 primary infection.

Note=Colocalizes with gamma-tubulin during interphase and mitosis. Appears to associate with the mother centriole during G1 phase and with daughter centrioles towards G1/S phase (By similarity). Localizes to the proximal ends of the centrioles (PubMed:24554434). Levels are high at interphase centrosomes but are reduced on mitotic spindle poles (PubMed:24554434). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:A9ZSY0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24554434}.","domain":"","geneNames":["CNTLN","C9orf101","C9orf39"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["centriole [GO:0005814]","centrosome [GO:0005813]","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["centriole-centriole cohesion [GO:0010457]","protein localization to organelle [GO:0033365]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["protein domain specific binding [GO:0019904]","protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]","protein-macromolecule adaptor activity [GO:0030674]"]}},"context":{}}

Plays a key role in the post-translational processing of flaviviral structural proteins prM, E, and NS1 (PubMed:27383988, PubMed:29593046). In HCV, it is involved in virion assembly where it promotes the interaction between HCV virus proteins NS2 and E2 (PubMed:24009510). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24009510, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27383988, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29593046}.","keywords":["Endoplasmic reticulum","Hydrolase","Membrane","Microsome","Protease","Reference proteome","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Microsome membrane {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P83362}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P83362}.

Has a role in chromosome translocation. The DNA helicase II complex binds preferentially to fork-like ends of double-stranded DNA in a cell cycle-dependent manner. It works in the 3'-5' direction. Binding to DNA may be mediated by XRCC6. Involved in DNA non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) required for double-strand break repair and V(D)J recombination. The XRCC5/6 dimer acts as regulatory subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex DNA-PK by increasing the affinity of the catalytic subunit PRKDC to DNA by 100-fold. The XRCC5/6 dimer is probably involved in stabilizing broken DNA ends and bringing them together (PubMed:12145306, PubMed:20383123, PubMed:7957065, PubMed:8621488). The assembly of the DNA-PK complex to DNA ends is required for the NHEJ ligation step. In association with NAA15, the XRCC5/6 dimer binds to the osteocalcin promoter and activates osteocalcin expression (PubMed:20383123). The XRCC5/6 dimer probably also acts as a 5'-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase (5'-dRP lyase), by catalyzing the beta-elimination of the 5' deoxyribose-5-phosphate at an abasic site near double-strand breaks. XRCC5 probably acts as the catalytic subunit of 5'-dRP activity, and allows to 'clean' the termini of abasic sites, a class of nucleotide damage commonly associated with strand breaks, before such broken ends can be joined. The XRCC5/6 dimer together with APEX1 acts as a negative regulator of transcription (PubMed:8621488). As part of the DNA-PK complex, involved in the early steps of ribosome assembly by promoting the processing of precursor rRNA into mature 18S rRNA in the small-subunit processome (PubMed:32103174). Binding to U3 small nucleolar RNA, recruits PRKDC and XRCC5/Ku86 to the small-subunit processome (PubMed:32103174). Plays a role in the regulation of DNA virus-mediated innate immune response by assembling into the HDP-RNP complex, a complex that serves as a platform for IRF3 phosphorylation and subsequent innate immune response activation through the cGAS-STING pathway. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12145306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20383123, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28712728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32103174, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7957065, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8621488}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ADP-ribosylation","ATP-binding","Acetylation","Activator","Chromosome","DNA damage","DNA recombination","DNA repair","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Helicase","Host-virus interaction","Hydrolase","Immunity","Innate immunity","Isopeptide bond","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ribosome biogenesis","Systemic lupus erythematosus","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22442688, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32103174}.

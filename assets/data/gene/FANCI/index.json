Required for maintenance of chromosomal stability. Specifically binds branched DNA: binds both single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Participates in S phase and G2 phase checkpoint activation upon DNA damage. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17412408, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17452773, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17460694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19111657}.","keywords":["Alternative splicing","Cell cycle","DNA damage","DNA repair","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Fanconi anemia","Isopeptide bond","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17412408, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17460694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19465922}. Note=Observed in spots localized in pairs on the sister chromatids of mitotic chromosome arms and not centromeres, one on each chromatids. These foci coincide with common fragile sites. They are frequently interlinked through BLM-associated ultra-fine DNA bridges.","domain":"","geneNames":["FANCI","KIAA1794"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]","membrane [GO:0016020]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cell cycle [GO:0007049]","interstrand cross-link repair [GO:0036297]","positive regulation of protein ubiquitination [GO:0031398]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["DNA binding [GO:0003677]","DNA polymerase binding [GO:0070182]"]}},"context":{}}

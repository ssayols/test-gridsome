Lamin A and C are present in equal amounts in the lamina of mammals. Plays an important role in nuclear assembly, chromatin organization, nuclear membrane and telomere dynamics. Required for normal development of peripheral nervous system and skeletal muscle and for muscle satellite cell proliferation (PubMed:10080180, PubMed:22431096, PubMed:10814726, PubMed:11799477, PubMed:18551513). Required for osteoblastogenesis and bone formation (PubMed:12075506, PubMed:15317753, PubMed:18611980). Also prevents fat infiltration of muscle and bone marrow, helping to maintain the volume and strength of skeletal muscle and bone (PubMed:10587585).

It acts to disrupt mitosis and induce DNA damage in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), leading to mitotic failure, genomic instability, and premature senescence.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cardiomyopathy","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease","Coiled coil","Congenital muscular dystrophy","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy","Intermediate filament","Isopeptide bond","Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy","Lipoprotein","Methylation","Neurodegeneration","Neuropathy","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Prenylation","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15372542}.

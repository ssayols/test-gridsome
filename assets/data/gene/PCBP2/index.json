Major cellular poly(rC)-binding protein. Binds also poly(rU). Negatively regulates cellular antiviral responses mediated by MAVS signaling (PubMed:19881509). It acts as an adapter between MAVS and the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH, therefore triggering MAVS ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:19881509). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12414943, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19881509}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) In case of infection by poliovirus, binds to the viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and stimulates the IRES-mediated translation (PubMed:12414943, PubMed:24371074). Also plays a role in initiation of viral RNA replication in concert with the viral protein 3CD (PubMed:12414943). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12414943, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24371074}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Antiviral defense","Cytoplasm","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Host-virus interaction","Immunity","Innate immunity","Isopeptide bond","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Repeat","Ribonucleoprotein","Ubl conjugation","Viral RNA replication"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19029303}.

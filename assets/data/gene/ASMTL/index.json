Can also hydrolyze CTP and the modified nucleotides pseudo-UTP, 5-methyl-UTP (m(5)UTP) and 5-methyl-CTP (m(5)CTP). Has weak activity with dCTP, 8-oxo-GTP and N(4)-methyl-dCTP (PubMed:24210219). May have a dual role in cell division arrest and in preventing the incorporation of modified nucleotides into cellular nucleic acids (PubMed:24210219). In addition, the presence of the putative catalytic domain of S-adenosyl-L-methionine binding in the C-terminal region argues for a methyltransferase activity (Probable). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24210219, ECO:0000305}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Hydrolase","Methyltransferase","Nucleotide metabolism","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","S-adenosyl-L-methionine","Transferase"],"subcellularLocation":"","domain":"","geneNames":["ASMTL"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["methylation [GO:0032259]","nucleotide metabolic process [GO:0009117]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["NADH pyrophosphatase activity [GO:0035529]","nucleoside-triphosphate diphosphatase activity [GO:0047429]","O-methyltransferase activity [GO:0008171]"]}},"context":{}}

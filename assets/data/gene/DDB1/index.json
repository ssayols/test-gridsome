Core component of the UV-DDB complex (UV-damaged DNA-binding protein complex), a complex that recognizes UV-induced DNA damage and recruit proteins of the nucleotide excision repair pathway (the NER pathway) to initiate DNA repair (PubMed:15448697, PubMed:16260596, PubMed:16407242, PubMed:16940174). The UV-DDB complex preferentially binds to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PP), apurinic sites and short mismatches (PubMed:15448697, PubMed:16260596, PubMed:16407242, PubMed:16940174). Also functions as a component of numerous distinct DCX (DDB1-CUL4-X-box) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes which mediate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:14739464, PubMed:16407252, PubMed:16482215, PubMed:17079684, PubMed:25043012, PubMed:25108355, PubMed:18332868, PubMed:18381890, PubMed:19966799, PubMed:22118460, PubMed:28886238). The functional specificity of the DCX E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex is determined by the variable substrate recognition component recruited by DDB1 (PubMed:14739464, PubMed:16407252, PubMed:16482215, PubMed:17079684, PubMed:25043012, PubMed:25108355, PubMed:18332868, PubMed:18381890, PubMed:19966799, PubMed:22118460). DCX(DDB2) (also known as DDB1-CUL4-ROC1, CUL4-DDB-ROC1 and CUL4-DDB-RBX1) may ubiquitinate histone H2A, histone H3 and histone H4 at sites of UV-induced DNA damage (PubMed:16678110, PubMed:17041588, PubMed:16473935, PubMed:18593899). The ubiquitination of histones may facilitate their removal from the nucleosome and promote subsequent DNA repair (PubMed:16678110, PubMed:17041588, PubMed:16473935, PubMed:18593899). DCX(DDB2) also ubiquitinates XPC, which may enhance DNA-binding by XPC and promote NER (PubMed:15882621). DCX(DTL) plays a role in PCNA-dependent polyubiquitination of CDT1 and MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of TP53 in response to radiation-induced DNA damage and during DNA replication (PubMed:17041588). DCX(ERCC8) (the CSA complex) plays a role in transcription-coupled repair (TCR) (PubMed:12732143). The DDB1-CUL4A-DTL E3 ligase complex regulates the circadian clock function by mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of CRY1 (PubMed:26431207). DDB1-mediated CRY1 degradation promotes FOXO1 protein stability and FOXO1-mediated gluconeogenesis in the liver (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q3U1J4, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12732143, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14739464, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15448697, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15882621, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16260596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16407242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16407252, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16473935, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16482215, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16678110, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16940174, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17041588, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17079684, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18332868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18381890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18593899, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19966799, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22118460, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25043012, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25108355, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26431207, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28886238}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Biological rhythms","Cytoplasm","DNA damage","DNA repair","DNA-binding","Host-virus interaction","Isopeptide bond","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Repeat","Ubl conjugation","Ubl conjugation pathway"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777491, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11673459, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18593899}.

Specifically binds to the upstream regulatory region of type I IFN and IFN-inducible MHC class I genes (the interferon consensus sequence (ICS)). Plays a negative regulatory role in cells of the immune system. Involved in CD8(+) dendritic cell differentiation by forming a complex with the BATF-JUNB heterodimer in immune cells, leading to recognition of AICE sequence (5'-TGAnTCA/GAAA-3'), an immune-specific regulatory element, followed by cooperative binding of BATF and IRF8 and activation of genes (By similarity). Positively regulates macroautophagy in dendritic cells (PubMed:29434592). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P23611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25122610, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29434592}.","keywords":["Activator","Autophagy","Cytoplasm","DNA-binding","Disease mutation","Nucleus","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Repressor","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23166356, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25122610}.

Required for the progression from the G1 to the S phase. Anti-apoptotic protein which functions as a caspase-3 inhibitor. Has no phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor activity (By similarity). Exhibits histone chaperone properties, stimulating core histones to assemble into a nucleosome. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20538007}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Chaperone","Cytoplasm","Leucine-rich repeat","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Repeat"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: [Isoform 1]: Nucleus.

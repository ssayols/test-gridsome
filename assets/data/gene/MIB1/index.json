Positively regulates the Delta-mediated Notch signaling by ubiquitinating the intracellular domain of Delta, leading to endocytosis of Delta receptors. Probably mediates ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of DAPK1, thereby antagonizing anti-apoptotic effects of DAPK1 to promote TNF-induced apoptosis (By similarity). Involved in ubiquitination of centriolar satellite CEP131, CEP290 and PCM1 proteins and hence inhibits primary cilium formation in proliferating cells. Mediates 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1, which probably participates in kinase activation. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24121310}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ANK repeat","Cardiomyopathy","Cell membrane","Coiled coil","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Disease mutation","Membrane","Metal-binding","Notch signaling pathway","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Repeat","Transferase","Ubl conjugation","Ubl conjugation pathway","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24121310}.

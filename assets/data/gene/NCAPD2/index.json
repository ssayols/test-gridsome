The condensin complex probably introduces positive supercoils into relaxed DNA in the presence of type I topoisomerases and converts nicked DNA into positive knotted forms in the presence of type II topoisomerases. May target the condensin complex to DNA via its C-terminal domain (PubMed:11136719). May promote the resolution of double-strand DNA catenanes (intertwines) between sister chromatids. Condensin-mediated compaction likely increases tension in catenated sister chromatids, providing directionality for type II topoisomerase-mediated strand exchanges toward chromatid decatenation. Required for decatenation of non-centromeric ultrafine DNA bridges during anaphase. Early in neurogenesis, may play an essential role to ensure accurate mitotic chromosome condensation in neuron stem cells, ultimately affecting neuron pool and cortex size (PubMed:27737959). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11136719, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27737959}.","keywords":["Cell cycle","Cell division","Chromosome","Cytoplasm","DNA condensation","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Mitosis","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Primary microcephaly","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10958694}.

Note=In interphase cells, the majority of the condensin complex is found in the cytoplasm, while a minority of the complex is associated with chromatin. A subpopulation of the complex however remains associated with chromosome foci in interphase cells. During mitosis, most of the condensin complex is associated with the chromatin. At the onset of prophase, the regulatory subunits of the complex are phosphorylated by CDK1, leading to condensin's association with chromosome arms and to chromosome condensation. Dissociation from chromosomes is observed in late telophase.","domain":"","geneNames":["NCAPD2","CAPD2","CNAP1","KIAA0159"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["condensed chromosome [GO:0000793]","condensed chromosome, centromeric region [GO:0000779]","condensin complex [GO:0000796]","condensin core heterodimer [GO:0000797]","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","membrane [GO:0016020]","nuclear condensin complex [GO:0000799]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cell division [GO:0051301]","chromosome separation [GO:0051304]","meiotic chromosome condensation [GO:0010032]","mitotic chromosome condensation [GO:0007076]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["chromatin binding [GO:0003682]","histone binding [GO:0042393]"]}},"context":{}}

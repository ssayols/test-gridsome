Second largest component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Proposed to contribute to the polymerase catalytic activity and forms the polymerase active center together with the largest subunit. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. RPB2 is part of the core element with the central large cleft, the clamp element that moves to open and close the cleft and the jaws that are thought to grab the incoming DNA template (By similarity). {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9852112}.","keywords":["3D-structure","DNA-directed RNA polymerase","Magnesium","Metal-binding","Methylation","Nucleotidyltransferase","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Transcription","Transferase","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9852112}.","domain":"","geneNames":["POLR2B"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["membrane [GO:0016020]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]","RNA polymerase II, core complex [GO:0005665]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["7-methylguanosine mRNA capping [GO:0006370]","fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathway [GO:0008543]","mRNA splicing, via spliceosome [GO:0000398]","positive regulation of viral transcription [GO:0050434]","regulation of gene silencing by miRNA [GO:0060964]","RNA metabolic process [GO:0016070]","snRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0042795]","somatic stem cell population maintenance [GO:0035019]","transcription, DNA-templated [GO:0006351]","transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0006366]","transcription-coupled nucleotide-excision repair [GO:0006283]","transcription elongation from RNA polymerase II promoter [GO:0006368]","transcription initiation from RNA polymerase II promoter [GO:0006367]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["chromatin binding [GO:0003682]","DNA binding [GO:0003677]","DNA-directed 5'-3' RNA polymerase activity [GO:0003899]","metal ion binding [GO:0046872]","ribonucleoside binding [GO:0032549]","RNA binding [GO:0003723]"]}},"context":{}}

Regulates the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of the Rho proteins by inhibiting the dissociation of GDP from them, and the subsequent binding of GTP to them. Retains Rho proteins such as CDC42, RAC1 and RHOA in an inactive cytosolic pool, regulating their stability and protecting them from degradation. Actively involved in the recycling and distribution of activated Rho GTPases in the cell, mediates extraction from membranes of both inactive and activated molecules due its exceptionally high affinity for prenylated forms. Through the modulation of Rho proteins, may play a role in cell motility regulation. In glioma cells, inhibits cell migration and invasion by mediating the signals of SEMA5A and PLXNB3 that lead to inactivation of RAC1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20400958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23434736}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","GTPase activation","Isopeptide bond","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23434736}.","domain":"","geneNames":["ARHGDIA","GDIA1"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytoskeleton [GO:0005856]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","membrane [GO:0016020]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["negative regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043066]","negative regulation of axonogenesis [GO:0050771]","negative regulation of cell adhesion [GO:0007162]","positive regulation of axonogenesis [GO:0050772]","regulation of actin cytoskeleton reorganization [GO:2000249]","regulation of Rho protein signal transduction [GO:0035023]","regulation of small GTPase mediated signal transduction [GO:0051056]","Rho protein signal transduction [GO:0007266]","semaphorin-plexin signaling pathway [GO:0071526]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["GTPase activator activity [GO:0005096]","Rac GTPase binding [GO:0048365]","Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor activity [GO:0005094]"]}},"context":{}}

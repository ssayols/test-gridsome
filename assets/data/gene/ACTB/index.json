Actin exists in both monomeric (G-actin) and polymeric (F-actin) forms, both forms playing key functions, such as cell motility and contraction (PubMed:29581253). In addition to their role in the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton, G- and F-actin also localize in the nucleus, and regulate gene transcription and motility and repair of damaged DNA (PubMed:29925947). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:29581253, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29925947}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Acetylation","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Deafness","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Dystonia","Isopeptide bond","Mental retardation","Methylation","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Oxidation","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11687588, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17289661}.

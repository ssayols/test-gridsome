The Integrator complex is associated with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II largest subunit (POLR2A) and is recruited to the U1 and U2 snRNAs genes (Probable). Plays a role in DNA damage response (DDR) signaling during the S phase (PubMed:21659603). May be not involved in the recruitment of cytoplasmic dynein to the nuclear envelope by different components of the INT complex (PubMed:23904267). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21659603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23904267, ECO:0000305|PubMed:16239144}.","keywords":["Alternative splicing","Chromosome","Cytoplasm","DNA damage","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21659603}.

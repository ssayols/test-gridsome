Plays a multifaceted role in triglyceride homeostasis (PubMed:18201179, PubMed:22510806). Intracellularly, promotes hepatic very low density lipoprotein 1 (VLDL1) assembly and secretion; extracellularly, attenuates hydrolysis and clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) (PubMed:18201179, PubMed:22510806). Impairs the lipolysis of TRLs by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase and the hepatic uptake of TRLs by remnant receptors (PubMed:18201179, PubMed:22510806). Formed of several curved helices connected via semiflexible hinges, so that it can wrap tightly around the curved micelle surface and easily adapt to the different diameters of its natural binding partners (PubMed:18408013). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18408013, ECO:0000303|PubMed:18201179, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22510806}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Chylomicron","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Glycoprotein","Lipid degradation","Lipid metabolism","Lipid transport","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Secreted","Sialic acid","Signal","Transport","VLDL"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted {ECO:0000303|PubMed:18201179, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22510806}.","domain":"","geneNames":["APOC3"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["chylomicron [GO:0042627]","collagen-containing extracellular matrix [GO:0062023]","early endosome [GO:0005769]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","extracellular region [GO:0005576]","extracellular space [GO:0005615]","intermediate-density lipoprotein particle [GO:0034363]","spherical high-density lipoprotein particle [GO:0034366]","very-low-density lipoprotein particle [GO:0034361]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cholesterol efflux [GO:0033344]","cholesterol homeostasis [GO:0042632]","chylomicron assembly [GO:0034378]","chylomicron remnant clearance [GO:0034382]","chylomicron remodeling [GO:0034371]","G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007186]","high-density lipoprotein particle remodeling [GO:0034375]","lipoprotein metabolic process [GO:0042157]","negative regulation of cholesterol import [GO:0060621]","negative regulation of fatty acid biosynthetic process [GO:0045717]","negative regulation of high-density lipoprotein particle clearance [GO:0010987]","negative regulation of lipid catabolic process [GO:0050995]","negative regulation of lipid metabolic process [GO:0045833]","negative regulation of lipoprotein lipase activity [GO:0051005]","negative regulation of low-density lipoprotein particle clearance [GO:0010989]","negative regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis [GO:0048261]","negative regulation of triglyceride catabolic process [GO:0010897]","negative regulation of very-low-density lipoprotein particle clearance [GO:0010916]","negative regulation of very-low-density lipoprotein particle remodeling [GO:0010903]","phospholipid efflux [GO:0033700]","regulation of Cdc42 protein signal transduction [GO:0032489]","retinoid metabolic process [GO:0001523]","reverse cholesterol transport [GO:0043691]","triglyceride catabolic process [GO:0019433]","triglyceride homeostasis [GO:0070328]","triglyceride metabolic process [GO:0006641]","very-low-density lipoprotein particle assembly [GO:0034379]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["cholesterol binding [GO:0015485]","enzyme regulator activity [GO:0030234]","high-density lipoprotein particle receptor binding [GO:0070653]","lipase inhibitor activity [GO:0055102]","phospholipid binding [GO:0005543]"]}},"context":{}}

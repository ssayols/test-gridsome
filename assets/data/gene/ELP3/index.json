The elongator complex is required for multiple tRNA modifications, including mcm5U (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl uridine), mcm5s2U (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine), and ncm5U (5-carbamoylmethyl uridine) (PubMed:29415125). In the elongator complex, acts as a tRNA uridine(34) acetyltransferase by mediating formation of carboxymethyluridine in the wobble base at position 34 in tRNAs (By similarity). May also act as a protein lysine acetyltransferase by mediating acetylation of target proteins; such activity is however unclear in vivo and recent evidences suggest that ELP3 primarily acts as a tRNA acetyltransferase (PubMed:29415125). Involved in neurogenesis: regulates the migration and branching of projection neurons in the developing cerebral cortex, through a process depending on alpha-tubulin acetylation (PubMed:19185337). Required for acetylation of GJA1 in the developing cerebral cortex (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:D5VRB9, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9CZX0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11714725, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11818576, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15902492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16713582, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19185337, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29415125}.","keywords":["4Fe-4S","Acyltransferase","Alternative splicing","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","Cytoplasm","Iron","Iron-sulfur","Metal-binding","Methylation","Neurodegeneration","Neurogenesis","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","S-adenosyl-L-methionine","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Transferase","tRNA processing","tRNA-binding"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11818576, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19185337, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22854966}.

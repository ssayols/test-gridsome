The cohesin complex may also play a role in spindle pole assembly during mitosis (PubMed:11590136). In interphase, cohesins may function in the control of gene expression by binding to numerous sites within the genome (By similarity). May control RUNX1 gene expression (Probable). Binds to and represses APOB gene promoter (PubMed:25575569). May play a role in embryonic gut development, possibly through the regulation of enteric neuron development (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q61550, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6TEL1, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11509732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11590136, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25575569, ECO:0000305|PubMed:25575569}.; FUNCTION: [64-kDa C-terminal product]: May promote apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11875078, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12417729}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Activator","Apoptosis","Cell cycle","Cell division","Centromere","Chromosome","Chromosome partition","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","DNA damage","DNA repair","Developmental protein","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Isopeptide bond","Mental retardation","Mitosis","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Repressor","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: [Double-strand-break repair protein rad21 homolog]: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11073952, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11509732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12417729}.

Before prophase, scattered along chromosome arms (PubMed:11073952). During prophase and prometaphase, most cohesins dissociate from the arms of condensing chromosome, possibly through PLK1-mediated phosphorylation (PubMed:11931760). A small amount of cohesin remains in centromeric regions and is removed from chromosomes only at the onset of anaphase. At anaphase, cleavage by separase/ESPL1 leads to the dissociation of cohesin from chromosomes and chromosome separation (PubMed:11073952, PubMed:11509732). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11073952, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11509732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11590136, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11931760}.; SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: [64-kDa C-terminal product]: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11875078, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12417729}.

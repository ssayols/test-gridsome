Activates the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa-B) transcription factor. Promotes anchorage-independent growth of immortalized melanocytes and astrocytes which is a key component in tumor cell expansion. Promotes lung metastasis and also has an effect on bone and brain metastasis, possibly by enhancing the seeding of tumor cells to the target organ endothelium. Induces chemoresistance. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15927426, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16452207, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18316612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19111877}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Cell junction","Cytoplasm","Endoplasmic reticulum","Membrane","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Tight junction","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Single-pass membrane protein.

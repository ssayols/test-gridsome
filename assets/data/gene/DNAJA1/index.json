Stimulates ATP hydrolysis, but not the folding of unfolded proteins mediated by HSPA1A (in vitro) (PubMed:24318877). Plays a role in protein transport into mitochondria via its role as co-chaperone. Functions as co-chaperone for HSPA1B and negatively regulates the translocation of BAX from the cytosol to mitochondria in response to cellular stress, thereby protecting cells against apoptosis (PubMed:14752510). Promotes apoptosis in response to cellular stress mediated by exposure to anisomycin or UV (PubMed:24512202). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10816573, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14752510, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24318877, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24512202, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9192730}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Chaperone","Cytoplasm","Endoplasmic reticulum","Lipoprotein","Membrane","Metal-binding","Methylation","Microsome","Mitochondrion","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Prenylation","Reference proteome","Repeat","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane {ECO:0000305|PubMed:10816573}; Lipid-anchor {ECO:0000305|PubMed:10816573}.

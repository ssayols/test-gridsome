In the nucleus, in association with RANBP3, binds cooperatively to the NES on its target protein and to the GTPase RAN in its active GTP-bound form (Ran-GTP). Docking of this complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated through binding to nucleoporins. Upon transit of a nuclear export complex into the cytoplasm, disassembling of the complex and hydrolysis of Ran-GTP to Ran-GDP (induced by RANBP1 and RANGAP1, respectively) cause release of the cargo from the export receptor. The directionality of nuclear export is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Involved in U3 snoRNA transport from Cajal bodies to nucleoli. Binds to late precursor U3 snoRNA bearing a TMG cap. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15574332, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20921223, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311922, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9323133}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Mediates the export of unspliced or incompletely spliced RNAs out of the nucleus from different viruses including HIV-1, HTLV-1 and influenza A.

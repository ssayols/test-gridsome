Integrin ITGAL/ITGB2 is also a receptor for the secreted form of ubiquitin-like protein ISG15; the interaction is mediated by ITGAL (PubMed:29100055). Integrins ITGAM/ITGB2 and ITGAX/ITGB2 are receptors for the iC3b fragment of the third complement component and for fibrinogen. Integrin ITGAX/ITGB2 recognizes the sequence G-P-R in fibrinogen alpha-chain. Integrin ITGAM/ITGB2 recognizes P1 and P2 peptides of fibrinogen gamma chain. Integrin ITGAM/ITGB2 is also a receptor for factor X. Integrin ITGAD/ITGB2 is a receptor for ICAM3 and VCAM1. Contributes to natural killer cell cytotoxicity (PubMed:15356110). Involved in leukocyte adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes including T-cells and neutrophils (PubMed:11812992, PubMed:28807980). Triggers neutrophil transmigration during lung injury through PTK2B/PYK2-mediated activation (PubMed:18587400). Integrin ITGAL/ITGB2 in association with ICAM3, contributes to apoptotic neutrophil phagocytosis by macrophages (PubMed:23775590). In association with alpha subunit ITGAM/CD11b, required for CD177-PRTN3-mediated activation of TNF primed neutrophils (PubMed:21193407). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11812992, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15356110, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18587400, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21193407, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23775590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28807980, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29100055}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Cell adhesion","Cell membrane","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Disulfide bond","Glycoprotein","Integrin","Membrane","Metal-binding","Phagocytosis","Phosphoprotein","Pyrrolidone carboxylic acid","Receptor","Reference proteome","Repeat","Signal","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21193407, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28807980}; Single-pass type I membrane protein {ECO:0000305}.

Participates in nuclear events including transcription, RNA transport, DNA replication and apoptosis. Nuclear functions are probably due to the nitrosylase activity that mediates cysteine S-nitrosylation of nuclear target proteins such as SIRT1, HDAC2 and PRKDC. Modulates the organization and assembly of the cytoskeleton. Facilitates the CHP1-dependent microtubule and membrane associations through its ability to stimulate the binding of CHP1 to microtubules (By similarity). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is a key enzyme in glycolysis that catalyzes the first step of the pathway by converting D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) into 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate. Component of the GAIT (gamma interferon-activated inhibitor of translation) complex which mediates interferon-gamma-induced transcript-selective translation inhibition in inflammation processes. Upon interferon-gamma treatment assembles into the GAIT complex which binds to stem loop-containing GAIT elements in the 3'-UTR of diverse inflammatory mRNAs (such as ceruplasmin) and suppresses their translation. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11724794, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23071094, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3170585}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ADP-ribosylation","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Apoptosis","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Direct protein sequencing","Glycolysis","Isopeptide bond","Membrane","Methylation","NAD","Nucleus","Oxidation","Oxidoreductase","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","S-nitrosylation","Transferase","Translation regulation","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12829261}.

In the presence of ATP, stimulation of DNA polymerase delta-mediated DNA synthesis is decreased. Plays also a role in the innate immune defense against viruses. Stabilizes the RIG-I/DDX58 dsRNA interaction and promotes RIG-I/DDX58 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination. In turn, RIG-I/DDX58 transmits the signal through mitochondrial MAVS. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15670210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29053956}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","DNA damage","DNA repair","DNA replication","Hydrolase","Immunity","Innate immunity","Isopeptide bond","Metal-binding","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18842586}.

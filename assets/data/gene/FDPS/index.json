FPP also serves as substrate for protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation. Catalyzes the sequential condensation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate with the allylic pyrophosphates, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, and then with the resultant geranylpyrophosphate to the ultimate product farnesyl pyrophosphate.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cholesterol biosynthesis","Cholesterol metabolism","Cytoplasm","Disease mutation","Host-virus interaction","Isoprene biosynthesis","Lipid biosynthesis","Lipid metabolism","Magnesium","Metal-binding","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Steroid biosynthesis","Steroid metabolism","Sterol biosynthesis","Sterol metabolism","Transferase"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.","domain":"","geneNames":["FDPS","FPS","KIAA1293"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cholesterol biosynthetic process [GO:0006695]","farnesyl diphosphate biosynthetic process [GO:0045337]","geranyl diphosphate biosynthetic process [GO:0033384]","regulation of cholesterol biosynthetic process [GO:0045540]","viral process [GO:0016032]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["dimethylallyltranstransferase activity [GO:0004161]","geranyltranstransferase activity [GO:0004337]","metal ion binding [GO:0046872]","RNA binding [GO:0003723]"]}},"context":{}}

Preferentially deubiquitinates monoubiquitinated H2A in hyperacetylated nucleosomes. Deubiquitination of histone H2A leads to facilitate the phosphorylation and dissociation of histone H1 from the nucleosome. Acts as a coactivator by participating in the initiation and elongation steps of androgen receptor (AR)-induced gene activation.

Binds to ubiquitinated cargo proteins and is required for the sorting of endocytic ubiquitinated cargos into multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Mediates the association between the ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I complex. Required for completion of cytokinesis; the function requires CEP55. May be involved in cell growth and differentiation. Acts as a negative growth regulator. Involved in the budding of many viruses through an interaction with viral proteins that contain a late-budding motif P-[ST]-A-P. This interaction is essential for viral particle budding of numerous retroviruses. Required for the exosomal release of SDCBP, CD63 and syndecan (PubMed:22660413). It may also play a role in the extracellular release of microvesicles that differ from the exosomes (PubMed:22315426). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11916981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17556548, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17853893, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21070952, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21757351, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22315426, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22660413}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cell cycle","Cell division","Coiled coil","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Endosome","Growth regulation","Host-virus interaction","Membrane","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Protein transport","Reference proteome","Transport","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17853893}.

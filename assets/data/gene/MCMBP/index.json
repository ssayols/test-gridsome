Binds to the MCM complex during late S phase and promotes the disassembly of the MCM complex from chromatin, thereby acting as a key regulator of pre-replication complex (pre-RC) unloading from replicated DNA. Can dissociate the MCM complex without addition of ATP; probably acts by destabilizing interactions of each individual subunits of the MCM complex. Required for sister chromatid cohesion. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20090939, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21196493}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Cell cycle","Cell division","DNA replication","Mitosis","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17296731}. Note=Associates with chromatin. Highly associated with chromatin in G1/S and S phases, reduced binding to chromatin in G2, and further decreased binding in early M phase. It then reassociates with chromatin in late M phase. Dissociates from chromatin later than component of the MCM complex.","domain":"","geneNames":["MCMBP","C10orf119"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cell junction [GO:0030054]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","nuclear chromatin [GO:0000790]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cell division [GO:0051301]","DNA-dependent DNA replication [GO:0006261]","sister chromatid cohesion [GO:0007062]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["chromatin binding [GO:0003682]"]}},"context":{}}

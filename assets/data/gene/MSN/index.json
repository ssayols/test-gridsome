Tethers actin filaments by oscillating between a resting and an activated state providing transient interactions between moesin and the actin cytoskeleton (PubMed:10212266). Once phosphorylated on its C-terminal threonine, moesin is activated leading to interaction with F-actin and cytoskeletal rearrangement (PubMed:10212266). These rearrangements regulate many cellular processes, including cell shape determination, membrane transport, and signal transduction (PubMed:12387735, PubMed:15039356). The role of moesin is particularly important in immunity acting on both T and B-cells homeostasis and self-tolerance, regulating lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs (PubMed:9298994, PubMed:9616160). Modulates phagolysosomal biogenesis in macrophages (By similarity). Participates also in immunologic synapse formation (PubMed:27405666). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P26041, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10212266, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12387735, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15039356, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27405666, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298994, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9616160}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Cell membrane","Cell projection","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Host-virus interaction","Membrane","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","S-nitrosylation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11728332, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15039356, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18586956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7884872, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298994}; Peripheral membrane protein {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P26041}; Cytoplasmic side {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P26041}.

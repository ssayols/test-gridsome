Activates exon skipping of its own pre-mRNA during muscle cell differentiation. Binds to the polypyrimidine tract of introns. May promote RNA looping when bound to two separate polypyrimidine tracts in the same pre-mRNA. May promote the binding of U2 snRNP to pre-mRNA. Cooperates with RAVER1 to modulate switching between mutually exclusive exons during maturation of the TPM1 pre-mRNA. Represses the splicing of MAPT/Tau exon 10 (PubMed:15009664). In case of infection by picornaviruses, binds to the viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and stimulates the IRES-mediated translation (PubMed:21518806). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11003644, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15009664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16179478, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16260624, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21518792, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21518806}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Activator","Alternative splicing","Direct protein sequencing","Isopeptide bond","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Repeat","Repressor","Ubl conjugation","mRNA processing","mRNA splicing"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.","domain":"DOMAIN 59..143;  /note=\"RRM 1\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00176\"; DOMAIN 184..260;  /note=\"RRM 2\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00176\"; DOMAIN 337..411;  /note=\"RRM 3\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00176\"; DOMAIN 454..529;  /note=\"RRM 4\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00176\"","geneNames":["PTBP1","PTB"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","membrane [GO:0016020]","nucleolus [GO:0005730]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathway [GO:0008543]","IRES-dependent viral translational initiation [GO:0075522]","mRNA processing [GO:0006397]","mRNA splicing, via spliceosome [GO:0000398]","negative regulation of mRNA splicing, via spliceosome [GO:0048025]","negative regulation of muscle cell differentiation [GO:0051148]","negative regulation of RNA splicing [GO:0033119]","positive regulation of calcineurin-NFAT signaling cascade [GO:0070886]","positive regulation of protein dephosphorylation [GO:0035307]","regulation of alternative mRNA splicing, via spliceosome [GO:0000381]","regulation of cell differentiation [GO:0045595]","regulation of RNA splicing [GO:0043484]","regulation of translation [GO:0006417]","RNA metabolic process [GO:0016070]","RNA splicing [GO:0008380]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["mRNA binding [GO:0003729]","poly-pyrimidine tract binding [GO:0008187]","pre-mRNA binding [GO:0036002]","RNA binding [GO:0003723]"]}},"context":{}}

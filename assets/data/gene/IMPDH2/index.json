Could also have a single-stranded nucleic acid-binding activity and could play a role in RNA and/or DNA metabolism. It may also have a role in the development of malignancy and the growth progression of some tumors.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","CBS domain","Cytoplasm","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","GMP biosynthesis","Isopeptide bond","Metal-binding","NAD","Nucleus","Oxidoreductase","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Potassium","Purine biosynthesis","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Repeat","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14766016}.

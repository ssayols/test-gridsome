The TRiC complex mediates the folding of WRAP53/TCAB1, thereby regulating telomere maintenance (PubMed:25467444). As part of the TRiC complex may play a role in the assembly of BBSome, a complex involved in ciliogenesis regulating transports vesicles to the cilia (PubMed:20080638). The TRiC complex plays a role in the folding of actin and tubulin (Probable). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20080638, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25467444, ECO:0000305}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Acetylation","Chaperone","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Direct protein sequencing","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1630492}.

This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair. PSMD4 acts as an ubiquitin receptor subunit through ubiquitin-interacting motifs and selects ubiquitin-conjugates for destruction. Displays a preferred selectivity for longer polyubiquitin chains. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1317798, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15826667}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Direct protein sequencing","Isopeptide bond","Phosphoprotein","Proteasome","Reference proteome","Repeat","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"","domain":"DOMAIN 5..188;  /note=\"VWFA\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00219\"; DOMAIN 211..230;  /note=\"UIM 1\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00213\"; DOMAIN 282..301;  /note=\"UIM 2\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00213\"","geneNames":["PSMD4","MCB1"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]","proteasome accessory complex [GO:0022624]","proteasome complex [GO:0000502]","proteasome regulatory particle, base subcomplex [GO:0008540]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["anaphase-promoting complex-dependent catabolic process [GO:0031145]","antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class I, TAP-dependent [GO:0002479]","Fc-epsilon receptor signaling pathway [GO:0038095]","interleukin-1-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0070498]","MAPK cascade [GO:0000165]","negative regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway [GO:0090090]","negative regulation of G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0010972]","NIK/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:0038061]","positive regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway [GO:0090263]","post-translational protein modification [GO:0043687]","proteasome assembly [GO:0043248]","proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0043161]","protein deubiquitination [GO:0016579]","protein polyubiquitination [GO:0000209]","regulation of cellular amino acid metabolic process [GO:0006521]","regulation of hematopoietic stem cell differentiation [GO:1902036]","regulation of mitotic cell cycle phase transition [GO:1901990]","regulation of mRNA stability [GO:0043488]","regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter in response to hypoxia [GO:0061418]","SCF-dependent proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0031146]","stimulatory C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway [GO:0002223]","T cell receptor signaling pathway [GO:0050852]","transmembrane transport [GO:0055085]","tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0033209]","Wnt signaling pathway, planar cell polarity pathway [GO:0060071]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["identical protein binding [GO:0042802]","polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding [GO:0031593]","RNA binding [GO:0003723]"]}},"context":{}}

Acts as docking protein and induces translocation of PTPN6, PTPN11 and other binding partners from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Supports adhesion of cerebellar neurons, neurite outgrowth and glial cell attachment. May play a key role in intracellular signaling during synaptogenesis and in synaptic function (By similarity). Involved in the negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase-coupled cellular responses induced by cell adhesion, growth factors or insulin. Mediates negative regulation of phagocytosis, mast cell activation and dendritic cell activation. CD47 binding prevents maturation of immature dendritic cells and inhibits cytokine production by mature dendritic cells. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10469599, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11509594}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Disulfide bond","Glycoprotein","Immunoglobulin domain","Membrane","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Repeat","SH3-binding","Signal","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; Single-pass type I membrane protein.","domain":"DOMAIN 32..137;  /note=\"Ig-like V-type\"; DOMAIN 148..247;  /note=\"Ig-like C1-type 1\"; DOMAIN 254..348;  /note=\"Ig-like C1-type 2\"","geneNames":["SIRPA","BIT","MFR","MYD1","PTPNS1","SHPS1","SIRP"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cell surface [GO:0009986]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","ficolin-1-rich granule membrane [GO:0101003]","integral component of plasma membrane [GO:0005887]","membrane [GO:0016020]","plasma membrane [GO:0005886]","tertiary granule membrane [GO:0070821]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cell adhesion [GO:0007155]","cell migration [GO:0016477]","cellular response to hydrogen peroxide [GO:0070301]","cellular response to interferon-gamma [GO:0071346]","cellular response to interleukin-1 [GO:0071347]","cellular response to interleukin-12 [GO:0071349]","cellular response to lipopolysaccharide [GO:0071222]","leukocyte migration [GO:0050900]","monocyte extravasation [GO:0035696]","negative regulation of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 production [GO:0071650]","negative regulation of cytokine production involved in inflammatory response [GO:1900016]","negative regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade [GO:0070373]","negative regulation of I-kappaB phosphorylation [GO:1903720]","negative regulation of inflammatory response [GO:0050728]","negative regulation of interferon-beta production [GO:0032688]","negative regulation of interleukin-6 production [GO:0032715]","negative regulation of JNK cascade [GO:0046329]","negative regulation of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha production [GO:0071641]","negative regulation of nitric oxide biosynthetic process [GO:0045019]","negative regulation of phagocytosis [GO:0050765]","negative regulation of protein phosphorylation [GO:0001933]","negative regulation of tumor necrosis factor production [GO:0032720]","neutrophil degranulation [GO:0043312]","positive regulation of cell-cell adhesion [GO:0022409]","positive regulation of phagocytosis [GO:0050766]","positive regulation of T cell activation [GO:0050870]","regulation of gene expression [GO:0010468]","regulation of interferon-gamma production [GO:0032649]","regulation of interleukin-1 beta production [GO:0032651]","regulation of interleukin-6 production [GO:0032675]","regulation of nitric oxide biosynthetic process [GO:0045428]","regulation of tumor necrosis factor production [GO:0032680]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["cell-cell adhesion mediator activity [GO:0098632]","GTPase regulator activity [GO:0030695]","protein antigen binding [GO:1990405]","protein binding involved in heterotypic cell-cell adhesion [GO:0086080]","protein phosphatase binding [GO:0019903]","protein tyrosine kinase binding [GO:1990782]","SH3 domain binding [GO:0017124]"]}},"context":{}}

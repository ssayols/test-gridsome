Covalent attachment to its substrates requires prior activation by the E1 complex UBE1C-APPBP1 and linkage to the E2 enzyme UBE2M. Attachment of NEDD8 to cullins activates their associated E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and thus promotes polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of cyclins and other regulatory proteins. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10318914, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10597293, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11953428}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Direct protein sequencing","Isopeptide bond","Nucleus","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation pathway"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9353319}.

Not involved in deposition of H2A.Z/H2AZ1 in the nucleosome. May stabilize the evicted H2A.Z/H2AZ1-H2B dimer, thus shifting the equilibrium towards dissociation and the off-chromatin state (PubMed:24463511). Inhibits activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Does not inhibit protein phosphatase 1. May play a role in cerebellar development and synaptogenesis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24463511}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Chaperone","Chromatin regulator","Cytoplasm","Isopeptide bond","Leucine-rich repeat","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Repeat","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250}.

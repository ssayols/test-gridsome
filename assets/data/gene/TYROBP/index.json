TYROBP is tyrosine-phosphorylated in the ITAM domain following ligand binding by the associated receptors which leads to activation of additional tyrosine kinases and subsequent cell activation (PubMed:9490415). Also has an inhibitory role in some cells (PubMed:21727189). Non-covalently associates with activating receptors of the CD300 family to mediate cell activation (PubMed:15557162, PubMed:16920917, PubMed:17928527; PubMed:26221034). Also mediates cell activation through association with activating receptors of the CD200R family (By similarity). Required for neutrophil activation mediated by integrin (By similarity). Required for the activation of myeloid cells mediated by the CLEC5A/MDL1 receptor (PubMed:10449773). Associates with natural killer (NK) cell receptors such as KIR2DS2 and the KLRD1/KLRC2 heterodimer to mediate NK cell activation (PubMed:9490415, PubMed:9655483, PubMed:23715743). Also enhances trafficking and cell surface expression of NK cell receptors KIR2DS1, KIR2DS2 and KIR2DS4 and ensures their stability at the cell surface (PubMed:23715743). Associates with SIRPB1 to mediate activation of myeloid cells such as monocytes and dendritic cells (PubMed:10604985). Associates with TREM1 to mediate activation of neutrophils and monocytes (PubMed:10799849). Associates with TREM2 on monocyte-derived dendritic cells to mediate up-regulation of chemokine receptor CCR7 and dendritic cell maturation and survival (PubMed:11602640). Association with TREM2 mediates cytokine-induced formation of multinucleated giant cells which are formed by the fusion of macrophages (PubMed:18957693). Stabilizes the TREM2 C-terminal fragment (TREM2-CTF) produced by TREM2 ectodomain shedding which suppresses the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (PubMed:25957402). In microglia, required with TREM2 for phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons (By similarity). Required with ITGAM/CD11B in microglia to control production of microglial superoxide ions which promote the neuronal apoptosis that occurs during brain development (By similarity). Promotes proinflammatory responses in microglia following nerve injury which accelerates degeneration of injured neurons (By similarity). Positively regulates the expression of the IRAK3/IRAK-M kinase and IL10 production by liver dendritic cells and inhibits their T cell allostimulatory ability (By similarity). Negatively regulates B cell proliferation (PubMed:21727189). Required for CSF1-mediated osteoclast cytoskeletal organization (By similarity). Positively regulates multinucleation during osteoclast development (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O54885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10449773, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10604985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10799849, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11602640, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15557162, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16920917, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17928527, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18957693, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21727189, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23715743, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25957402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26221034, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9490415, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9655483}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Cell membrane","Disulfide bond","Immunity","Membrane","Metal-binding","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Signal","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9655483}; Single-pass type I membrane protein {ECO:0000255}.","domain":"DOMAIN 80..108;  /note=\"ITAM\"","geneNames":["TYROBP","DAP12","KARAP"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cell [GO:0005623]","cell surface [GO:0009986]","integral component of membrane [GO:0016021]","integral component of plasma membrane [GO:0005887]","plasma membrane [GO:0005886]","secretory granule membrane [GO:0030667]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["actin cytoskeleton organization [GO:0030036]","apoptotic cell clearance [GO:0043277]","apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:0097190]","cellular defense response [GO:0006968]","forebrain development [GO:0030900]","innate immune response [GO:0045087]","integrin-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0007229]","intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]","microglial cell activation involved in immune response [GO:0002282]","myeloid leukocyte activation [GO:0002274]","negative regulation of B cell proliferation [GO:0030889]","negative regulation of interleukin-10 biosynthetic process [GO:0045081]","negative regulation of long-term synaptic potentiation [GO:1900272]","negative regulation of transforming growth factor beta1 production [GO:0032911]","neutrophil degranulation [GO:0043312]","osteoclast differentiation [GO:0030316]","positive regulation of gene expression [GO:0010628]","positive regulation of hippocampal neuron apoptotic process [GO:0110090]","positive regulation of interleukin-1 beta biosynthetic process [GO:0050725]","positive regulation of interleukin-6 biosynthetic process [GO:0045410]","positive regulation of macrophage fusion [GO:0034241]","positive regulation of microglial cell mediated cytotoxicity [GO:1904151]","positive regulation of natural killer cell activation [GO:0032816]","positive regulation of neuron death [GO:1901216]","positive regulation of osteoclast development [GO:2001206]","positive regulation of protein localization to cell surface [GO:2000010]","positive regulation of receptor localization to synapse [GO:1902685]","positive regulation of superoxide anion generation [GO:0032930]","positive regulation of tumor necrosis factor biosynthetic process [GO:0042535]","protein stabilization [GO:0050821]","regulation of immune response [GO:0050776]","response to axon injury [GO:0048678]","signal transduction [GO:0007165]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["identical protein binding [GO:0042802]","metal ion binding [GO:0046872]","signaling receptor binding [GO:0005102]"]}},"context":{}}

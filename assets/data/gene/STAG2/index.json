The cohesin complex apparently forms a large proteinaceous ring within which sister chromatids can be trapped. At anaphase, the complex is cleaved and dissociates from chromatin, allowing sister chromatids to segregate. The cohesin complex may also play a role in spindle pole assembly during mitosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12034751}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cell cycle","Cell division","Centromere","Chromosome","Chromosome partition","Disease mutation","Meiosis","Mitosis","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Chromosome. Chromosome, centromere. Note=Associates with chromatin. Before prophase it is scattered along chromosome arms. During prophase, most of cohesin complexes dissociate from chromatin probably because of phosphorylation by PLK1, except at centromeres, where cohesin complexes remain. At anaphase, the RAD21 subunit of cohesin is cleaved, leading to the dissociation of the complex from chromosomes, allowing chromosome separation. In germ cells, cohesin complex dissociates from chromatin at prophase I, and may be replaced by a meiosis-specific cohesin complex.","domain":"DOMAIN 293..378;  /note=\"SCD\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00750\"","geneNames":["STAG2","SA2"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["chromatin [GO:0000785]","chromosome [GO:0005694]","chromosome, centromeric region [GO:0000775]","cohesin complex [GO:0008278]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","membrane [GO:0016020]","mitotic spindle pole [GO:0097431]","nuclear matrix [GO:0016363]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cell division [GO:0051301]","meiotic cell cycle [GO:0051321]","mitotic spindle assembly [GO:0090307]","sister chromatid cohesion [GO:0007062]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["chromatin binding [GO:0003682]"]}},"context":{}}

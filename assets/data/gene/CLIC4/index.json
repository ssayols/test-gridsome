Channel activity depends on the pH. Membrane insertion seems to be redox-regulated and may occur only under oxydizing conditions. Promotes cell-surface expression of HRH3. Has alternate cellular functions like a potential role in angiogenesis or in maintaining apical-basolateral membrane polarity during mitosis and cytokinesis. Could also promote endothelial cell proliferation and regulate endothelial morphogenesis (tubulogenesis). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12163372, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14569596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16176272, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16239224, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18302930, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19247789}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Cell junction","Cell membrane","Chloride","Chloride channel","Cytoplasm","Cytoplasmic vesicle","Cytoskeleton","Direct protein sequencing","Ion channel","Ion transport","Membrane","Mitochondrion","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix","Transport","Voltage-gated channel"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, microtubule organizing center, centrosome.

Binds directly and selectively to MYC and CCND2 RNAs. In neuronal cells, directly binds to several mRNAs associated with RNA granules, including BDNF, CAMK2A, CREB1, MAP2, NTRK2 mRNAs, as well as to GRIN1 and KPNB1 mRNAs, but not to rRNAs. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17210633}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cell projection","Coiled coil","Cytoplasm","Differentiation","Direct protein sequencing","Glycoprotein","Methylation","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Protein synthesis inhibitor","RNA-binding","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:28733330}.

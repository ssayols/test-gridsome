Active against multiple viruses, including influenza A virus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Marburg virus (MARV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Dengue virus (DNV), West Nile virus (WNV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Can inhibit: influenza virus hemagglutinin protein-mediated viral entry, MARV and EBOV GP1,2-mediated viral entry and SARS-CoV S protein-mediated viral entry. Also implicated in cell adhesion and control of cell growth and migration. Plays a key role in the antiproliferative action of IFN-gamma either by inhibiting the ERK activation or by arresting cell growth in G1 phase in a p53-dependent manner. Acts as a positive regulator of osteoblast differentiation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16847454, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20064371, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20838853, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21177806, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21253575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21976647, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22479637, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22634173}.","keywords":["Antiviral defense","Cell membrane","Immunity","Innate immunity","Lipoprotein","Membrane","Osteogenesis","Palmitate","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1383329, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19499152, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25105503}; Single-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19499152}.","domain":"","geneNames":["IFITM1","CD225","IFI17"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["integral component of membrane [GO:0016021]","membrane [GO:0016020]","plasma membrane [GO:0005886]","protein-containing complex [GO:0032991]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cell surface receptor signaling pathway [GO:0007166]","defense response to virus [GO:0051607]","negative regulation of cell migration [GO:0030336]","negative regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008285]","negative regulation of viral entry into host cell [GO:0046597]","negative regulation of viral genome replication [GO:0045071]","ossification [GO:0001503]","positive regulation of osteoblast differentiation [GO:0045669]","regulation of immune response [GO:0050776]","response to interferon-alpha [GO:0035455]","response to interferon-beta [GO:0035456]","response to interferon-gamma [GO:0034341]","response to virus [GO:0009615]","type I interferon signaling pathway [GO:0060337]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":[""]}},"context":{}}

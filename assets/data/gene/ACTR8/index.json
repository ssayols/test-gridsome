Exhibits low basal ATPase activity, and unable to polymerize.; FUNCTION: Proposed core component of the chromatin remodeling INO80 complex which is involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA replication and probably DNA repair. Required for the recruitment of INO80 (and probably the INO80 complex) to sites of DNA damage. Strongly prefer nucleosomes and H3-H4 tetramers over H2A-H2B dimers, suggesting it may act as a nucleosome recognition module within the complex.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cell cycle","Cell division","Chromosome","DNA damage","DNA recombination","DNA repair","Mitosis","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Transcription","Transcription regulation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18163988}.

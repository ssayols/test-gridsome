Central component of cohesin complex. The cohesin complex is required for the cohesion of sister chromatids after DNA replication. The cohesin complex apparently forms a large proteinaceous ring within which sister chromatids can be trapped. At anaphase, the complex is cleaved and dissociates from chromatin, allowing sister chromatids to segregate. The cohesin complex may also play a role in spindle pole assembly during mitosis. Involved in DNA repair via its interaction with BRCA1 and its related phosphorylation by ATM, or via its phosphorylation by ATR. Works as a downstream effector both in the ATM/NBS1 branch and in the ATR/MSH2 branch of S-phase checkpoint. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11877377}.","keywords":["ATP-binding","Acetylation","Cell cycle","Cell division","Centromere","Chromosome","Coiled coil","DNA damage","DNA repair","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Kinetochore","Meiosis","Mental retardation","Mitosis","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12199140}.

During prophase, most of cohesin complexes dissociate from chromatin probably because of phosphorylation by PLK, except at centromeres, where cohesin complexes remain. At anaphase, the RAD21 subunit of the cohesin complex is cleaved, leading to the dissociation of the complex from chromosomes, allowing chromosome separation. In germ cells, cohesin complex dissociates from chromatin at prophase I, and may be replaced by a meiosis-specific cohesin complex. The phosphorylated form on Ser-957 and Ser-966 associates with chromatin during G1/S/G2 phases but not during M phase, suggesting that phosphorylation does not regulate cohesin function. Integral component of the functional centromere-kinetochore complex at the kinetochore region during mitosis.","domain":"DOMAIN 515..629;  /note=\"SMC hinge\"","geneNames":["SMC1A","DXS423E","KIAA0178","SB1.8","SMC1","SMC1L1"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["chromosome [GO:0005694]","chromosome, centromeric region [GO:0000775]","cohesin complex [GO:0008278]","condensed chromosome kinetochore [GO:0000777]","condensed nuclear chromosome [GO:0000794]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","kinetochore [GO:0000776]","meiotic cohesin complex [GO:0030893]","mitotic spindle pole [GO:0097431]","nuclear matrix [GO:0016363]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cell division [GO:0051301]","DNA repair [GO:0006281]","meiotic cell cycle [GO:0051321]","mitotic sister chromatid cohesion [GO:0007064]","mitotic sister chromatid segregation [GO:0000070]","mitotic spindle assembly [GO:0090307]","response to DNA damage checkpoint signaling [GO:0072423]","response to radiation [GO:0009314]","sister chromatid cohesion [GO:0007062]","stem cell population maintenance [GO:0019827]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["ATP binding [GO:0005524]","chromatin binding [GO:0003682]","mediator complex binding [GO:0036033]","protein heterodimerization activity [GO:0046982]","RNA binding [GO:0003723]"]}},"context":{}}

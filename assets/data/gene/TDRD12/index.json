Acts via the piRNA metabolic process, which mediates the repression of transposable elements during meiosis by forming complexes composed of piRNAs and Piwi proteins and governs the methylation and subsequent repression of transposons. Involved in the secondary piRNAs metabolic process. Acts via the PET complex, a multiprotein complex required during the secondary piRNAs metabolic process for the PIWIL2 slicing-triggered loading of PIWIL4 piRNAs. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9CWU0}.","keywords":["ATP-binding","Alternative splicing","Developmental protein","Differentiation","Helicase","Hydrolase","Meiosis","Nucleotide-binding","RNA-mediated gene silencing","Reference proteome","Repeat","Spermatogenesis"],"subcellularLocation":"","domain":"DOMAIN 56..118;  /note=\"Tudor 1\"; DOMAIN 447..635;  /note=\"Helicase ATP-binding\"; DOMAIN 900..999;  /note=\"Tudor 2\"","geneNames":["TDRD12","ECAT8"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["PET complex [GO:1990923]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cell differentiation [GO:0030154]","DNA methylation involved in gamete generation [GO:0043046]","fertilization [GO:0009566]","gene silencing by RNA [GO:0031047]","male meiotic nuclear division [GO:0007140]","multicellular organism development [GO:0007275]","piRNA metabolic process [GO:0034587]","spermatogenesis [GO:0007283]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["ATP binding [GO:0005524]","nucleic acid binding [GO:0003676]","RNA helicase activity [GO:0003724]"]}},"context":{}}

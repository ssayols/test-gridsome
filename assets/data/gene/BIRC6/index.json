Has an unusual ubiquitin conjugation system in that it could combine in a single polypeptide, ubiquitin conjugating (E2) with ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity, forming a chimeric E2/E3 ubiquitin ligase. Its tragets include CASP9 and DIABLO/SMAC. Acts as an inhibitor of CASP3, CASP7 and CASP9. Important regulator for the final stages of cytokinesis. Crucial for normal vesicle targeting to the site of abscission, but also for the integrity of the midbody and the midbody ring, and its striking ubiquitin modification. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14765125, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15200957, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18329369}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Apoptosis","Cell cycle","Cell division","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Endosome","Golgi apparatus","Membrane","Mitosis","Phosphoprotein","Protease inhibitor","Reference proteome","Thiol protease inhibitor","Transferase","Ubl conjugation","Ubl conjugation pathway"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus, trans-Golgi network membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18329369}.

Concentrates in a pericentriolar compartment in interphase, moves partially to spindle poles in metaphase, and finally localizes to the spindle midzone and the midbody in telophase and during cytokinesis. On the midbody, localizes to the midbody ring, also called Flemming body (PubMed:18329369). In interphase cells, localizes to the trans-Golgi network membrane and endosomes. During cytokinesis, a fraction moves to the midzone where it specifically arrives at the midbody ring. After abscission completion, travels with the midbody remnant into one daughter cell, and remains bound to it until a new midbody ring is formed during the next cell division (PubMed:18329369). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18329369}.","domain":"","geneNames":["BIRC6","KIAA1289"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["endosome [GO:0005768]","Flemming body [GO:0090543]","membrane [GO:0016020]","microtubule organizing center [GO:0005815]","midbody [GO:0030496]","nucleus [GO:0005634]","spindle pole [GO:0000922]","trans-Golgi network [GO:0005802]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["apoptotic process [GO:0006915]","cell cycle [GO:0007049]","cell division [GO:0051301]","labyrinthine layer development [GO:0060711]","negative regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043066]","negative regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:2001237]","positive regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008284]","protein phosphorylation [GO:0006468]","protein ubiquitination [GO:0016567]","regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0042127]","regulation of cytokinesis [GO:0032465]","spongiotrophoblast layer development [GO:0060712]","ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0006511]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["cysteine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity [GO:0004869]","ubiquitin conjugating enzyme activity [GO:0061631]","ubiquitin-protein transferase activity [GO:0004842]"]}},"context":{}}

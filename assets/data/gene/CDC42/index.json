In active state binds to a variety of effector proteins to regulate cellular responses. Involved in epithelial cell polarization processes. Regulates the bipolar attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores before chromosome congression in metaphase (PubMed:15642749). Regulates cell migration (PubMed:17038317). In neurons, plays a role in the extension and maintenance of the formation of filopodia, thin and actin-rich surface projections (PubMed:14978216). Required for DOCK10-mediated spine formation in Purkinje cells and hippocampal neurons. Facilitates filopodia formation upon DOCK11-activation (By similarity). Upon activation by CaMKII, modulates dendritic spine structural plasticity by relaying CaMKII transient activation to synapse-specific, long-term signaling (By similarity). Also plays a role in phagocytosis through organization of the F-actin cytoskeleton associated with forming phagocytic cups (PubMed:26465210). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P60766, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8CFN2, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14978216, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15642749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17038317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26465210}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Cell membrane","Cell projection","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Differentiation","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","GTP-binding","Glycoprotein","Hydrolase","Lipoprotein","Membrane","Mental retardation","Methylation","Neurogenesis","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Prenylation","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000305}; Lipid-anchor {ECO:0000305}; Cytoplasmic side {ECO:0000305}.

Moves to the central spindle as cells progressed through anaphase to telophase (PubMed:15642749). Localizes at the end of cytokinesis in the intercellular bridge formed between two daughter cells (PubMed:15642749). Its localization is regulated by the activities of guanine nucleotide exchange factor ECT2 and GTPase activating protein RACGAP1 (PubMed:15642749). Colocalizes with NEK6 in the centrosome (PubMed:20873783). In its active GTP-bound form localizes to the leading edge membrane of migrating dendritic cells (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P60766, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15642749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20873783}.","domain":"","geneNames":["CDC42"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["apical part of cell [GO:0045177]","cell [GO:0005623]","cell-cell junction [GO:0005911]","cell cortex [GO:0005938]","cell projection [GO:0042995]","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granule [GO:0036464]","cytoplasmic vesicle [GO:0031410]","cytoskeleton [GO:0005856]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","dendritic spine [GO:0043197]","endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","filopodium [GO:0030175]","focal adhesion [GO:0005925]","Golgi membrane [GO:0000139]","Golgi transport complex [GO:0017119]","intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]","leading edge membrane [GO:0031256]","membrane [GO:0016020]","microtubule organizing center [GO:0005815]","midbody [GO:0030496]","mitotic spindle [GO:0072686]","neuronal cell body [GO:0043025]","neuron projection [GO:0043005]","phagocytic vesicle [GO:0045335]","plasma membrane [GO:0005886]","protein-containing complex [GO:0032991]","Schaffer collateral -

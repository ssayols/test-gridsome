The ATP gamma phosphate is transferred to the NDP beta phosphate via a ping-pong mechanism, using a phosphorylated active-site intermediate. Possesses nucleoside-diphosphate kinase, serine/threonine-specific protein kinase, geranyl and farnesyl pyrophosphate kinase, histidine protein kinase and 3'-5' exonuclease activities. Involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and development, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor endocytosis, and gene expression. Required for neural development including neural patterning and cell fate determination. During GZMA-mediated cell death, works in concert with TREX1. NME1 nicks one strand of DNA and TREX1 removes bases from the free 3' end to enhance DNA damage and prevent DNA end reannealing and rapid repair. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12628186, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16818237, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8810265}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Differentiation","Direct protein sequencing","Endocytosis","Isopeptide bond","Kinase","Magnesium","Metal-binding","Neurogenesis","Nucleotide metabolism","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Transferase","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16442775}.

Plays a pivotal role in the protein quality control system, ensuring the correct folding of proteins, the re-folding of misfolded proteins and controlling the targeting of proteins for subsequent degradation. This is achieved through cycles of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and ADP release, mediated by co-chaperones. The co-chaperones have been shown to not only regulate different steps of the ATPase cycle, but they also have an individual specificity such that one co-chaperone may promote folding of a substrate while another may promote degradation. The affinity for polypeptides is regulated by its nucleotide bound state. In the ATP-bound form, it has a low affinity for substrate proteins. However, upon hydrolysis of the ATP to ADP, it undergoes a conformational change that increases its affinity for substrate proteins. It goes through repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange, which permits cycles of substrate binding and release. The co-chaperones are of three types: J-domain co-chaperones such as HSP40s (stimulate ATPase hydrolysis by HSP70), the nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) such as BAG1/2/3 (facilitate conversion of HSP70 from the ADP-bound to the ATP-bound state thereby promoting substrate release), and the TPR domain chaperones such as HOPX and STUB1 (PubMed:24012426, PubMed:26865365, PubMed:24318877). Maintains protein homeostasis during cellular stress through two opposing mechanisms: protein refolding and degradation. Its acetylation/deacetylation state determines whether it functions in protein refolding or protein degradation by controlling the competitive binding of co-chaperones HOPX and STUB1. During the early stress response, the acetylated form binds to HOPX which assists in chaperone-mediated protein refolding, thereafter, it is deacetylated and binds to ubiquitin ligase STUB1 that promotes ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (PubMed:27708256). Regulates centrosome integrity during mitosis, and is required for the maintenance of a functional mitotic centrosome that supports the assembly of a bipolar mitotic spindle (PubMed:27137183). Enhances STUB1-mediated SMAD3 ubiquitination and degradation and facilitates STUB1-mediated inhibition of TGF-beta signaling (PubMed:24613385). Essential for STUB1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of FOXP3 in regulatory T-cells (Treg) during inflammation (PubMed:23973223). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22528486, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23973223, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24318877, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24613385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27137183, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27708256, ECO:0000303|PubMed:24012426, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26865365}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) In case of rotavirus A infection, serves as a post-attachment receptor for the virus to facilitate entry into the cell. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16537599}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Acetylation","Chaperone","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Direct protein sequencing","Host cell receptor for virus entry","Host-virus interaction","Methylation","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Receptor","Reference proteome","Stress response"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17289661}.

Promotes neddylation of cullin components of E3 cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes. Acts by binding to cullin-RBX1 complexes in the cytoplasm and promoting their nuclear translocation, enhancing recruitment of E2-NEDD8 (UBE2M-NEDD8) thioester to the complex, and optimizing the orientation of proteins in the complex to allow efficient transfer of NEDD8 from the E2 to the cullin substrates. Involved in the release of inhibitory effets of CAND1 on cullin-RING ligase E3 complex assembly and activity (PubMed:25349211, PubMed:28581483). Acts also as an oncogene facilitating malignant transformation and carcinogenic progression (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9QZ73, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25349211, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28581483}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Nucleus","Proto-oncogene","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation pathway"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25349211}.","domain":"DOMAIN 8..45;  /note=\"UBA-like\"; DOMAIN 60..248;  /note=\"DCUN1\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00574\"","geneNames":["DCUN1D1","DCN1","DCUN1L1","RP42","SCCRO"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","ubiquitin ligase complex [GO:0000151]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["positive regulation of protein neddylation [GO:2000436]","positive regulation of ubiquitin-protein transferase activity [GO:0051443]","post-translational protein modification [GO:0043687]","protein neddylation [GO:0045116]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["cullin family protein binding [GO:0097602]","ubiquitin conjugating enzyme binding [GO:0031624]","ubiquitin-like protein binding [GO:0032182]"]}},"context":{}}

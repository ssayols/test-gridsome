Participates thereby in a wide variety of cellular functions including the activation, recirculation and homing of T-lymphocytes, hematopoiesis, inflammation and response to bacterial infection (PubMed:7528188). Engages, through its ectodomain, extracellular matrix components such as hyaluronan/HA, collagen, growth factors, cytokines or proteases and serves as a platform for signal transduction by assembling, via its cytoplasmic domain, protein complexes containing receptor kinases and membrane proteases (PubMed:18757307, PubMed:23589287). Such effectors include PKN2, the RhoGTPases RAC1 and RHOA, Rho-kinases and phospholipase C that coordinate signaling pathways promoting calcium mobilization and actin-mediated cytoskeleton reorganization essential for cell migration and adhesion (PubMed:15123640). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15123640, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16541107, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18757307, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19703720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726066, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23589287, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7528188}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Blood group antigen","Cell adhesion","Cell membrane","Cell projection","Direct protein sequencing","Disulfide bond","Glycoprotein","Membrane","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Proteoglycan","Receptor","Reference proteome","Signal","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726066, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23589287}; Single-pass type I membrane protein {ECO:0000255}.

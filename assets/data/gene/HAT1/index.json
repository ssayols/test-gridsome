Has intrinsic substrate specificity that modifies lysine in recognition sequence GXGKXG. May be involved in nucleosome assembly during DNA replication and repair as part of the histone H3.1 and H3.3 complexes. May play a role in DNA repair in response to free radical damage. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11585814, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20953179, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22615379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9427644}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Acyltransferase","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Transferase"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: [Isoform A]: Nucleus matrix.; SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: [Isoform B]: Cytoplasm.

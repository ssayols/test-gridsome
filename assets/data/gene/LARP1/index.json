Interacts on the one hand with the 3' poly-A tails that are present in all mRNA molecules, and on the other hand with the 7-methylguanosine cap structure of mRNAs containing a 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (5'TOP) motif, which is present in mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and several components of the translation machinery (PubMed:23711370, PubMed:25940091, PubMed:28650797, PubMed:29244122, PubMed:26206669, PubMed:28379136). The interaction with the 5' end of mRNAs containing a 5'TOP motif leads to translational repression by preventing the binding of EIF4G1 (PubMed:25940091, PubMed:28650797, PubMed:29244122, PubMed:28379136). When mTORC1 is activated, LARP1 is phosphorylated and dissociates from the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA (PubMed:25940091, PubMed:28650797). Does not prevent binding of EIF4G1 to mRNAs that lack a 5'TOP motif (PubMed:28379136). Interacts with the free 40S ribosome subunit and with ribosomes, both monosomes and polysomes (PubMed:20430826, PubMed:24532714, PubMed:25940091, PubMed:28673543). Under normal nutrient availability, interacts primarily with the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and increases protein synthesis (PubMed:23711370, PubMed:28650797). Associates with actively translating ribosomes and stimulates translation of mRNAs containing a 5'TOP motif, thereby regulating protein synthesis, and as a consequence, cell growth and proliferation (PubMed:20430826, PubMed:24532714). Stabilizes mRNAs species with a 5'TOP motif, which is required to prevent apoptosis (PubMed:20430826, PubMed:23711370, PubMed:25940091, PubMed:28673543). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20430826, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23711370, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24532714, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25940091, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26206669, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28379136, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28650797, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28673543, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29244122}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Positively regulates the replication of dengue virus (DENV). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26735137}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Isopeptide bond","Methylation","Phosphoprotein","Protein biosynthesis","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Repressor","Translation regulation","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20430826, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24532714, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28650797}.

Binds to nascent polypeptide chains as they emerge from the ribosome and blocks their interaction with the signal recognition particle (SRP), which normally targets nascent secretory peptides to the ER. Also reduces the inherent affinity of ribosomes for protein translocation sites in the ER membrane (M sites). May act as a specific coactivator for JUN, binding to DNA and stabilizing the interaction of JUN homodimers with target gene promoters. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10982809, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15784678, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9877153}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Allergen","Alternative splicing","Chaperone","Cytoplasm","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Isopeptide bond","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Protein transport","Reference proteome","Transcription","Transport","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.

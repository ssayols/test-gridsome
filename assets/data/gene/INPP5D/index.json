Able also to hydrolyzes the 5-phosphate of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P3) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (PubMed:9108392, PubMed:10764818, PubMed:8769125). Acts as a negative regulator of B-cell antigen receptor signaling. Mediates signaling from the FC-gamma-RIIB receptor (FCGR2B), playing a central role in terminating signal transduction from activating immune/hematopoietic cell receptor systems. Acts as a negative regulator of myeloid cell proliferation/survival and chemotaxis, mast cell degranulation, immune cells homeostasis, integrin alpha-IIb/beta-3 signaling in platelets and JNK signaling in B-cells. Regulates proliferation of osteoclast precursors, macrophage programming, phagocytosis and activation and is required for endotoxin tolerance. Involved in the control of cell-cell junctions, CD32a signaling in neutrophils and modulation of EGF-induced phospholipase C activity (PubMed:16682172). Key regulator of neutrophil migration, by governing the formation of the leading edge and polarization required for chemotaxis. Modulates FCGR3/CD16-mediated cytotoxicity in NK cells. Mediates the activin/TGF-beta-induced apoptosis through its Smad-dependent expression. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10764818, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12421919, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16682172, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8723348, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8769125, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9108392}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Apoptosis","Cell membrane","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Hydrolase","Immunity","Membrane","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Repeat","SH2 domain","SH3-binding"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10822173}.

Note=Translocates to the plasma membrane when activated, translocation is probably due to different mechanisms depending on the stimulus and cell type. Translocates from the cytoplasm to membrane ruffles in a FCGR3/CD16-dependent manner. Colocalizes with FC-gamma-RIIB receptor (FCGR2B) or FCGR3/CD16 at membrane ruffles. Tyrosine phosphorylation may also participate in membrane localization. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9ES52}.","domain":"DOMAIN 5..101;  /note=\"SH2\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00191\"","geneNames":["INPP5D","SHIP","SHIP1"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytoskeleton [GO:0005856]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","membrane raft [GO:0045121]","plasma membrane [GO:0005886]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["apoptotic process [GO:0006915]","cytokine-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0019221]","determination of adult lifespan [GO:0008340]","immunoglobulin mediated immune response [GO:0016064]","inositol phosphate metabolic process [GO:0043647]","intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]","leukocyte migration [GO:0050900]","negative regulation of B cell proliferation [GO:0030889]","negative regulation of bone resorption [GO:0045779]","negative regulation of immune response [GO:0050777]","negative regulation of interleukin-6 biosynthetic process [GO:0045409]","negative regulation of monocyte differentiation [GO:0045656]","negative regulation of neutrophil differentiation [GO:0045659]","negative regulation of osteoclast differentiation [GO:0045671]","negative regulation of signal transduction [GO:0009968]","phosphate-containing compound metabolic process [GO:0006796]","phosphatidylinositol biosynthetic process [GO:0006661]","phosphatidylinositol dephosphorylation [GO:0046856]","positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]","positive regulation of B cell differentiation [GO:0045579]","positive regulation of erythrocyte differentiation [GO:0045648]","signal transduction [GO:0007165]","T cell receptor signaling pathway [GO:0050852]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate 5-phosphatase activity [GO:0052659]","inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase activity [GO:0052658]","inositol-polyphosphate 5-phosphatase activity [GO:0004445]","phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase activity [GO:0016314]","phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase activity [GO:0004439]","SH3 domain binding [GO:0017124]"]}},"context":{}}

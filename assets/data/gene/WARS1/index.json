Isoform 2, T1-TrpRS and T2-TrpRS possess angiostatic activity whereas isoform 1 lacks it. T2-TrpRS inhibits fluid shear stress-activated responses of endothelial cells. Regulates ERK, Akt, and eNOS activation pathways that are associated with angiogenesis, cytoskeletal reorganization and shear stress-responsive gene expression. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11773625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11773626, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1373391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14630953, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28369220}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Alternative splicing","Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase","Angiogenesis","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Ligase","Neurodegeneration","Neuropathy","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Protein biosynthesis","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.","domain":"DOMAIN 8..64;  /note=\"WHEP-TRS\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00531\"","geneNames":["WARS1","IFI53","WARS","WRS"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","nucleus [GO:0005634]","protein-containing complex [GO:0032991]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["angiogenesis [GO:0001525]","negative regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008285]","negative regulation of protein kinase activity [GO:0006469]","negative regulation of protein phosphorylation [GO:0001933]","positive regulation of gene expression [GO:0010628]","positive regulation of protein-containing complex assembly [GO:0031334]","regulation of angiogenesis [GO:0045765]","regulation of protein ADP-ribosylation [GO:0010835]","translation [GO:0006412]","tRNA aminoacylation for protein translation [GO:0006418]","tryptophanyl-tRNA aminoacylation [GO:0006436]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["ATP binding [GO:0005524]","kinase inhibitor activity [GO:0019210]","protein domain specific binding [GO:0019904]","protein homodimerization activity [GO:0042803]","protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]","tryptophan-tRNA ligase activity [GO:0004830]"]}},"context":{}}

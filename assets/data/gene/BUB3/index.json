Promotes the formation of stable end-on bipolar attachments. Necessary for kinetochore localization of BUB1. Regulates chromosome segregation during oocyte meiosis. The BUB1/BUB3 complex plays a role in the inhibition of anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) when spindle-assembly checkpoint is activated and inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of APC/C by phosphorylating its activator CDC20. This complex can also phosphorylate MAD1L1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10198256, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15525512, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18199686}.","keywords":["ADP-ribosylation","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cell cycle","Cell division","Centromere","Chromosome","Chromosome partition","Isopeptide bond","Kinetochore","Meiosis","Mitosis","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Repeat","Ubl conjugation","WD repeat"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.

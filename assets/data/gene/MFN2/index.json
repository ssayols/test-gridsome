Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles, and their morphology is determined by the equilibrium between mitochondrial fusion and fission events (PubMed:28114303). Overexpression induces the formation of mitochondrial networks (PubMed:28114303). Membrane clustering requires GTPase activity and may involve a major rearrangement of the coiled coil domains (Probable). Plays a central role in mitochondrial metabolism and may be associated with obesity and/or apoptosis processes (By similarity). Plays an important role in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (By similarity). Involved in the clearance of damaged mitochondria via selective autophagy (mitophagy) (PubMed:23620051). Is required for PRKN recruitment to dysfunctional mitochondria (PubMed:23620051). Involved in the control of unfolded protein response (UPR) upon ER stress including activation of apoptosis and autophagy during ER stress (By similarity). Acts as an upstream regulator of EIF2AK3 and suppresses EIF2AK3 activation under basal conditions (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q80U63, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8R500, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11181170, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11950885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23620051, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26085578, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28114303, ECO:0000305}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Apoptosis","Autophagy","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease","Coiled coil","Disease mutation","GTP-binding","Hydrolase","Membrane","Mitochondrion","Mitochondrion outer membrane","Neurodegeneration","Neuropathy","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix","Ubl conjugation","Unfolded protein response"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion outer membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11181170, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11950885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12499352, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23620051}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11181170, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11950885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12499352, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23620051}.

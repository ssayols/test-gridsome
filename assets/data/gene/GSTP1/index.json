Involved in the formation of glutathione conjugates of both prostaglandin A2 (PGA2) and prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) (PubMed:9084911). Participates in the formation of novel hepoxilin regioisomers (PubMed:21046276). Regulates negatively CDK5 activity via p25/p35 translocation to prevent neurodegeneration. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21046276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21668448, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9084911}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Mitochondrion","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Transferase"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19269317}.

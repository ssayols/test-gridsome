Blocks both the RIG-I-like receptors (RLR) and NF-kappa-B pathways. Following viral infection, UBXN1 is induced and recruited to the RLR component MAVS. In turn, interferes with MAVS oligomerization, and disrupts the MAVS/TRAF3/TRAF6 signalosome. This function probably serves as a brake to prevent excessive RLR signaling (PubMed:23545497). Interferes with the TNFalpha-triggered NF-kappa-B pathway by interacting with cellular inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs) and thereby inhibiting their recruitment to TNFR1 (PubMed:25681446). Prevents also the activation of NF-kappa-B by associating with CUL1 and thus inhibiting NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha/NFKBIA degradation that remains bound to NF-kappa-B (PubMed:28152074). Interacts with the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer and regulates its activity. Specifically binds 'Lys-6'-linked polyubiquitin chains. Interaction with autoubiquitinated BRCA1 leads to the inhibition of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer (PubMed:20351172). Component of a complex required to couple deglycosylation and proteasome-mediated degradation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum that are retrotranslocated in the cytosol. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20351172, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23545497, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25681446, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28152074}.","keywords":["Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Coiled coil","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Host-virus interaction","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23545497}.","domain":"DOMAIN 2..42;  /note=\"UBA\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00212\"; DOMAIN 211..293;  /note=\"UBX\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00215\"","geneNames":["UBXN1","SAKS1"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","dendrite [GO:0030425]","endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]","neuronal cell body [GO:0043025]","nucleus [GO:0005634]","VCP-NPL4-UFD1 AAA ATPase complex [GO:0034098]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["negative regulation of ERAD pathway [GO:1904293]","negative regulation of proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0032435]","negative regulation of protein K48-linked deubiquitination [GO:1903094]","negative regulation of protein ubiquitination [GO:0031397]","negative regulation of ubiquitin-specific protease activity [GO:2000157]","proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0043161]","protein folding [GO:0006457]","viral process [GO:0016032]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["ATPase binding [GO:0051117]","K48-linked polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding [GO:0036435]","K6-linked polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding [GO:0071796]","polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding [GO:0031593]","proteasome regulatory particle binding [GO:1904855]","ubiquitin binding [GO:0043130]","ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]"]}},"context":{}}

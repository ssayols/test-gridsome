Together with methyltransferase BUD23, methylates the N(7) position of a guanine in 18S rRNA (PubMed:25851604). The heterodimer with HEMK2/N6AMT1 catalyzes N5-methylation of ETF1 on 'Gln-185', using S-adenosyl L-methionine as methyl donor (PubMed:18539146). The heterodimer with ALKBH8 catalyzes the methylation of 5-carboxymethyl uridine to 5-methylcarboxymethyl uridine at the wobble position of the anticodon loop in target tRNA species (PubMed:20308323). Involved in the pre-rRNA processing steps leading to small-subunit rRNA production (PubMed:25851604). Together with methyltransferase METTL5, specifically methylates the 6th position of adenine in position 1832 of 18S rRNA (PubMed:31328227). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18539146, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20308323, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25851604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31328227}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","rRNA processing"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus, nucleoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25851604}.

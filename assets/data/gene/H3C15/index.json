Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.","keywords":["3D-structure","ADP-ribosylation","Acetylation","Chromosome","Citrullination","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Hydroxylation","Lipoprotein","Methylation","Nucleosome core","Nucleus","Palmitate","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.

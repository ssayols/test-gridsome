Mediates responses to increased cellular Ca(2+)/calmodulin levels (By similarity). May be involved in regulatory processes in the central nervous system. May play a role in memory and learning. Plays a role in the regulation of the circadian rhythm of daytime contrast sensitivity probably by modulating the rhythmic synthesis of cyclic AMP in the retina (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O88444, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P19754}.","keywords":["ATP-binding","Biological rhythms","Calmodulin-binding","Cell membrane","Cytoplasm","Deafness","Glycoprotein","Lyase","Magnesium","Manganese","Membrane","Metal-binding","Non-syndromic deafness","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Repeat","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix","cAMP biosynthesis"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P19754}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P19754}.

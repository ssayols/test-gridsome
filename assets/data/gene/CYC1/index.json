The respiratory chain contains 3 multisubunit complexes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II, CII), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome b-c1 complex, complex III, CIII) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV), that cooperate to transfer electrons derived from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen, creating an electrochemical gradient over the inner membrane that drives transmembrane transport and the ATP synthase. The cytochrome b-c1 complex catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, linking this redox reaction to translocation of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane, with protons being carried across the membrane as hydrogens on the quinol. In the process called Q cycle, 2 protons are consumed from the matrix, 4 protons are released into the intermembrane space and 2 electrons are passed to cytochrome c. Cytochrome c1 is a catalytic core subunit containing a c-type heme. It transfers electrons from the [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster of the Rieske protein to cytochrome c. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P07143}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Disease mutation","Electron transport","Heme","Iron","Membrane","Metal-binding","Mitochondrion","Mitochondrion inner membrane","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Primary mitochondrial disease","Reference proteome","Respiratory chain","Transit peptide","Translocase","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix","Transport"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion inner membrane {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P07143}; Single-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P07143}.","domain":"DOMAIN 108..209;  /note=\"Cytochrome c\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00433\"","geneNames":["CYC1"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]","integral component of membrane [GO:0016021]","membrane [GO:0016020]","mitochondrial inner membrane [GO:0005743]","mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III [GO:0005750]","mitochondrion [GO:0005739]","nuclear body [GO:0016604]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled proton transport [GO:0042776]","mitochondrial electron transport, ubiquinol to cytochrome c [GO:0006122]","response to glucagon [GO:0033762]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["electron transporter, transferring electrons from CoQH2-cytochrome c reductase complex and cytochrome c oxidase complex activity [GO:0045155]","electron transporter, transferring electrons within CoQH2-cytochrome c reductase complex activity [GO:0045153]","heme binding [GO:0020037]","metal ion binding [GO:0046872]"]}},"context":{}}

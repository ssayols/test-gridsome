This endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymatic process, allows the addition of two carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids/VLCFAs per cycle. This enzyme has a 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase activity, reducing 3-ketoacyl-CoA to 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, within each cycle of fatty acid elongation. Thereby, it may participate in the production of VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators. May also catalyze the transformation of estrone (E1) into estradiol (E2) and play a role in estrogen formation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12482854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16166196}.","keywords":["Alternative splicing","Direct protein sequencing","Endoplasmic reticulum","Lipid biosynthesis","Lipid metabolism","Membrane","NADP","Oxidoreductase","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Steroid biosynthesis","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12482854}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12482854}.","domain":"","geneNames":["HSD17B12","SDR12C1"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]","extracellular matrix [GO:0031012]","integral component of membrane [GO:0016021]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["estrogen biosynthetic process [GO:0006703]","extracellular matrix organization [GO:0030198]","fatty acid biosynthetic process [GO:0006633]","long-chain fatty-acyl-CoA biosynthetic process [GO:0035338]","positive regulation of cell-substrate adhesion [GO:0010811]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["3-oxo-arachidoyl-CoA reductase activity [GO:0102339]","3-oxo-behenoyl-CoA reductase activity [GO:0102340]","3-oxo-cerotoyl-CoA reductase activity [GO:0102342]","3-oxo-lignoceroyl-CoA reductase activity [GO:0102341]","collagen binding [GO:0005518]","estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase activity [GO:0004303]","fibronectin binding [GO:0001968]","heparin binding [GO:0008201]"]}},"context":{}}

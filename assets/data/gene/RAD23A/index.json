Binds to 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains in a length-dependent manner and with a lower affinity to 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains. Proposed to be capable to bind simultaneously to the 26S proteasome and to polyubiquitinated substrates and to deliver ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome.; FUNCTION: Involved in nucleotide excision repair and is thought to be functional equivalent for RAD23B in global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) by association with XPC. In vitro, the XPC:RAD23A dimer has NER activity. Can stabilize XPC.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Involved in Vpr-dependent replication of HIV-1 in non-proliferating cells and primary macrophages. Required for the association of HIV-1 Vpr with the host proteasome. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20614012}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","DNA damage","DNA repair","Host-virus interaction","Isopeptide bond","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Proteasome","Reference proteome","Repeat","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.","domain":"DOMAIN 1..81;  /note=\"Ubiquitin-like\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00214\"; DOMAIN 161..201;  /note=\"UBA 1\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00212\"; DOMAIN 318..358;  /note=\"UBA 2\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00212\"","geneNames":["RAD23A"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["centriolar satellite [GO:0034451]","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","host cell nucleus [GO:0042025]","intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]","proteasome complex [GO:0000502]","protein-containing complex [GO:0032991]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["nucleotide-excision repair [GO:0006289]","positive regulation of cell cycle [GO:0045787]","positive regulation of proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0032436]","positive regulation of viral genome replication [GO:0045070]","proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0043161]","protein destabilization [GO:0031648]","protein deubiquitination [GO:0016579]","regulation of proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0032434]","viral process [GO:0016032]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["damaged DNA binding [GO:0003684]","kinase binding [GO:0019900]","polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding [GO:0031593]","proteasome binding [GO:0070628]","single-stranded DNA binding [GO:0003697]","ubiquitin binding [GO:0043130]","ubiquitin-specific protease binding [GO:1990381]"]}},"context":{}}

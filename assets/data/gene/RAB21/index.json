As a result, may regulate cell adhesion and migration (By similarity). During the mitosis of adherent cells, controls the endosomal trafficking of integrins which is required for the successful completion of cytokinesis (PubMed:18804435). Involved in neurite growth (By similarity). Following SBF2/MTMT13-mediated activation in response to starvation-induced autophagy, binds to and regulates SNARE protein VAMP8 endolysosomal transport required for SNARE-mediated autophagosome-lysosome fusion (PubMed:25648148). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P35282, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6AXT5, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18804435, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25648148}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Cell projection","Cytoplasmic vesicle","Direct protein sequencing","Endoplasmic reticulum","Endosome","GTP-binding","Golgi apparatus","Lipoprotein","Membrane","Methylation","Nucleotide-binding","Prenylation","Protein transport","Reference proteome","Transport"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10887961}; Lipid-anchor {ECO:0000305}.

Note=Colocalizes with ANKRD27 and VAMP7 in neurites (By similarity). In nonpolarized epithelial Caco-2 cells, found in the endoplasmic reticulum; in polarized cells, observed in vesicles in the apical cytoplasm (PubMed:10887961). During mitosis, in mid-telophase, localized in the ingressing cleavage furrow (PubMed:18804435). In late telophase, detected at the opposite poles of the daughter cells, in vesicles at the base of lamellipodia formed by the separating daughter cells (PubMed:18804435). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P35282, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10887961, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18804435}.","domain":"","geneNames":["RAB21","KIAA0118"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["axon cytoplasm [GO:1904115]","cleavage furrow [GO:0032154]","cytoplasmic side of early endosome membrane [GO:0098559]","cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane [GO:0009898]","cytoplasmic vesicle membrane [GO:0030659]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","early endosome [GO:0005769]","early endosome membrane [GO:0031901]","endomembrane system [GO:0012505]","endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]","endosome [GO:0005768]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","focal adhesion [GO:0005925]","Golgi cisterna membrane [GO:0032580]","synapse [GO:0045202]","trans-Golgi network [GO:0005802]","vesicle membrane [GO:0012506]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["anterograde axonal transport [GO:0008089]","intracellular protein transport [GO:0006886]","positive regulation of dendrite morphogenesis [GO:0050775]","positive regulation of early endosome to late endosome transport [GO:2000643]","positive regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis [GO:0048260]","Rab protein signal transduction [GO:0032482]","regulation of axon extension [GO:0030516]","regulation of exocytosis [GO:0017157]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["GDP binding [GO:0019003]","GTPase activity [GO:0003924]","GTP binding [GO:0005525]"]}},"context":{}}

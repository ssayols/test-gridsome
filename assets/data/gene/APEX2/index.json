Initiates repair of AP sites in DNA by catalyzing hydrolytic incision of the phosphodiester backbone immediately adjacent to the damage, generating a single-strand break with 5'-deoxyribose phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl ends. Displays also double-stranded DNA 3'-5' exonuclease, 3'-phosphodiesterase activities. Shows robust 3'-5' exonuclease activity on 3'-recessed heteroduplex DNA and is able to remove mismatched nucleotides preferentially. Shows fairly strong 3'-phosphodiesterase activity involved in the removal of 3'-damaged termini formed in DNA by oxidative agents. In the nucleus functions in the PCNA-dependent BER pathway. Required for somatic hypermutation (SHM) and DNA cleavage step of class switch recombination (CSR) of immunoglobulin genes. Required for proper cell cycle progression during proliferation of peripheral lymphocytes. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11376153, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16687656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19443450}.","keywords":["Cell cycle","Cytoplasm","DNA damage","DNA recombination","DNA repair","DNA-binding","Endonuclease","Exonuclease","Hydrolase","Magnesium","Metal-binding","Mitochondrion","Nuclease","Nucleus","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.

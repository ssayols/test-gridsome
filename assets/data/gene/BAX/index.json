Under normal conditions, BAX is largely cytosolic via constant retrotranslocation from mitochondria to the cytosol mediated by BCL2L1/Bcl-xL, which avoids accumulation of toxic BAX levels at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) (PubMed:21458670). Under stress conditions, undergoes a conformation change that causes translocation to the mitochondrion membrane, leading to the release of cytochrome c that then triggers apoptosis. Promotes activation of CASP3, and thereby apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10772918, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16113678, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18948948, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21199865, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21458670, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8358790, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8521816}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Apoptosis","Cytoplasm","Host-virus interaction","Membrane","Mitochondrion","Mitochondrion outer membrane","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix","Tumor suppressor"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: [Isoform Alpha]: Mitochondrion outer membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:29531808}; Single-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000255}.

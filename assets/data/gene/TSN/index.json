Seems to recognize single-stranded DNA ends generated by staggered breaks occurring at recombination hot spots.; FUNCTION: Exhibits both single-stranded and double-stranded endoribonuclease activity. May act as an activator of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) by facilitating endonucleolytic cleavage of the siRNA passenger strand.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","DNA-binding","Endonuclease","Hydrolase","Nuclease","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","RNA-binding","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11801738}.

Catalyzes the last of the four reactions of the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle (PubMed:12482854). This endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymatic process, allows the addition of 2 carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids/VLCFAs per cycle (PubMed:12482854). This enzyme reduces the trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA fatty acid intermediate to an acyl-CoA that can be further elongated by entering a new cycle of elongation (PubMed:12482854). Thereby, it participates in the production of VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators (PubMed:12482854). Catalyzes the saturation step of the sphingosine 1-phosphate metabolic pathway, the conversion of trans-2-hexadecenoyl-CoA to palmitoyl-CoA (PubMed:25049234). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12482854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25049234}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Disease mutation","Endoplasmic reticulum","Fatty acid biosynthesis","Fatty acid metabolism","Glycoprotein","Lipid biosynthesis","Lipid metabolism","Membrane","Mental retardation","NADP","Oxidoreductase","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Sphingolipid metabolism","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12482854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24220030}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000255}.","domain":"","geneNames":["TECR","GPSN2","SC2"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]","endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]","integral component of endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0030176]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["fatty acid elongation [GO:0030497]","long-chain fatty-acyl-CoA biosynthetic process [GO:0035338]","sphingolipid metabolic process [GO:0006665]","very long-chain fatty acid biosynthetic process [GO:0042761]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["oxidoreductase activity [GO:0016491]","very-long-chain enoyl-CoA reductase activity [GO:0102758]"]}},"context":{}}

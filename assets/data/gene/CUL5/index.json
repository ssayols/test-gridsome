As a scaffold protein may contribute to catalysis through positioning of the substrate and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The functional specificity of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex depends on the variable substrate recognition component. ECS(SOCS1) seems to direct ubiquitination of JAK2. Seems to be involved in proteosomal degradation of p53/TP53 stimulated by adenovirus E1B-55 kDa protein. May form a cell surface vasopressin receptor.","keywords":["3D-structure","Host-virus interaction","Isopeptide bond","Phosphoprotein","Receptor","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation","Ubl conjugation pathway"],"subcellularLocation":"","domain":"","geneNames":["CUL5","VACM1"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["Cul5-RING ubiquitin ligase complex [GO:0031466]","cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex [GO:0031461]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","SCF ubiquitin ligase complex [GO:0019005]","site of DNA damage [GO:0090734]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["ERBB2 signaling pathway [GO:0038128]","G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0000082]","intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:0097193]","post-translational protein modification [GO:0043687]","proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0043161]","SCF-dependent proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0031146]","ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0006511]","viral process [GO:0016032]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["calcium channel activity [GO:0005262]","signaling receptor activity [GO:0038023]","ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]","ubiquitin-protein transferase activity [GO:0004842]"]}},"context":{}}

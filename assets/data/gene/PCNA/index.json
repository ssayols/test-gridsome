Induces a robust stimulatory effect on the 3'-5' exonuclease and 3'-phosphodiesterase, but not apurinic-apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease, APEX2 activities. Has to be loaded onto DNA in order to be able to stimulate APEX2. Plays a key role in DNA damage response (DDR) by being conveniently positioned at the replication fork to coordinate DNA replication with DNA repair and DNA damage tolerance pathways (PubMed:24939902). Acts as a loading platform to recruit DDR proteins that allow completion of DNA replication after DNA damage and promote postreplication repair: Monoubiquitinated PCNA leads to recruitment of translesion (TLS) polymerases, while 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of PCNA is involved in error-free pathway and employs recombination mechanisms to synthesize across the lesion (PubMed:24695737). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18719106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19443450, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24695737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24939902}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","DNA damage","DNA repair","DNA replication","DNA-binding","Deafness","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Dwarfism","Host-virus interaction","Isopeptide bond","Methylation","Neurodegeneration","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24115439, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24939902}.

Forms nuclear foci representing sites of ongoing DNA replication and vary in morphology and number during S phase. Together with APEX2, is redistributed in discrete nuclear foci in presence of oxidative DNA damaging agents. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24939902}.","domain":"","geneNames":["PCNA"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["centrosome [GO:0005813]","chromatin [GO:0000785]","cyclin-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme complex [GO:0000307]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","nuclear body [GO:0016604]","nuclear chromosome, telomeric region [GO:0000784]","nuclear lamina [GO:0005652]","nuclear replication fork [GO:0043596]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","nucleus [GO:0005634]","PCNA complex [GO:0043626]","PCNA-p21 complex [GO:0070557]","replication fork [GO:0005657]","replisome [GO:0030894]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["base-excision repair, gap-filling [GO:0006287]","cellular response to hydrogen peroxide [GO:0070301]","cellular response to UV [GO:0034644]","cellular response to xenobiotic stimulus [GO:0071466]","DNA damage response, detection of DNA damage [GO:0042769]","DNA damage response, signal transduction by p53 class mediator resulting in cell cycle arrest [GO:0006977]","epithelial cell differentiation [GO:0030855]","error-free translesion synthesis [GO:0070987]","error-prone translesion synthesis [GO:0042276]","estrous cycle [GO:0044849]","heart development [GO:0007507]","leading strand elongation [GO:0006272]","liver regeneration [GO:0097421]","mismatch repair [GO:0006298]","mitotic telomere maintenance via semi-conservative replication [GO:1902990]","negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]","nucleotide-excision repair, DNA gap filling [GO:0006297]","nucleotide-excision repair, DNA incision [GO:0033683]","nucleotide-excision repair, DNA incision, 5'-to lesion [GO:0006296]","positive regulation of deoxyribonuclease activity [GO:0032077]","positive regulation of DNA-directed DNA polymerase activity [GO:1900264]","positive regulation of DNA repair [GO:0045739]","positive regulation of DNA replication [GO:0045740]","protein ubiquitination [GO:0016567]","regulation of transcription involved in G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle [GO:0000083]","replication fork processing [GO:0031297]","response to cadmium ion [GO:0046686]","response to dexamethasone [GO:0071548]","response to estradiol [GO:0032355]","response to L-glutamate [GO:1902065]","telomere maintenance [GO:0000723]","telomere maintenance via semi-conservative replication [GO:0032201]","transcription-coupled nucleotide-excision repair [GO:0006283]","translesion synthesis [GO:0019985]","viral process [GO:0016032]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["chromatin binding [GO:0003682]","damaged DNA binding [GO:0003684]","dinucleotide insertion or deletion binding [GO:0032139]","DNA polymerase binding [GO:0070182]","DNA polymerase processivity factor activity [GO:0030337]","enzyme binding [GO:0019899]","estrogen receptor binding [GO:0030331]","histone acetyltransferase binding [GO:0035035]","identical protein binding [GO:0042802]","MutLalpha complex binding [GO:0032405]","protein-containing complex binding [GO:0044877]","protein C-terminus binding [GO:0008022]","purine-specific mismatch base pair DNA N-glycosylase activity [GO:0000701]","receptor tyrosine kinase binding [GO:0030971]"]}},"context":{}}

In the current model of translation initiation, eIF4A unwinds RNA secondary structures in the 5'-UTR of mRNAs which is necessary to allow efficient binding of the small ribosomal subunit, and subsequent scanning for the initiator codon.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Alternative splicing","Helicase","Host-virus interaction","Hydrolase","Initiation factor","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Protein biosynthesis","RNA-binding","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"","domain":"DOMAIN 64..235;  /note=\"Helicase ATP-binding\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00541\"; DOMAIN 246..407;  /note=\"Helicase C-terminal\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00542\"","geneNames":["EIF4A2","DDX2B","EIF4F"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]","eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F complex [GO:0016281]","perinuclear region of cytoplasm [GO:0048471]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cellular response to leukemia inhibitory factor [GO:1990830]","cytoplasmic translational initiation [GO:0002183]","negative regulation of RNA-directed 5'-3' RNA polymerase activity [GO:1900260]","regulation of translational initiation [GO:0006446]","translational initiation [GO:0006413]","viral process [GO:0016032]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["ATPase activity [GO:0016887]","ATP binding [GO:0005524]","helicase activity [GO:0004386]","RNA binding [GO:0003723]","RNA helicase activity [GO:0003724]","translation initiation factor activity [GO:0003743]"]}},"context":{}}

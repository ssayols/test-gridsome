The eIF-3 complex associates with the 40S ribosome and facilitates the recruitment of eIF-1, eIF-1A, eIF-2:GTP:methionyl-tRNAi and eIF-5 to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC). The eIF-3 complex stimulates mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC and scanning of the mRNA for AUG recognition. The eIF-3 complex is also required for disassembly and recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes and subsequently prevents premature joining of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits prior to initiation (PubMed:17581632, PubMed:11169732). The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, and uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression (PubMed:25849773, PubMed:27462815). {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03000, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11169732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17581632, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25849773, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27462815}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Essential for the initiation of translation on type-1 viral ribosomal entry sites (IRESs), like for HCV, PV, EV71 or BEV translation (PubMed:23766293, PubMed:24357634). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23766293, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24357634}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) In case of FCV infection, plays a role in the ribosomal termination-reinitiation event leading to the translation of VP2 (PubMed:18056426). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18056426}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Coiled coil","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Host-virus interaction","Initiation factor","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Protein biosynthesis","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Repeat"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03000, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9150439}.","domain":"DOMAIN 315..498;  /note=\"PCI\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU01185\"","geneNames":["EIF3A","EIF3S10","KIAA0139"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","eukaryotic 43S preinitiation complex [GO:0016282]","eukaryotic 48S preinitiation complex [GO:0033290]","eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 complex [GO:0005852]","eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 complex, eIF3e [GO:0071540]","eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 complex, eIF3m [GO:0071541]","membrane [GO:0016020]","microtubule [GO:0005874]","multi-eIF complex [GO:0043614]","nucleolus [GO:0005730]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]","postsynaptic density [GO:0014069]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["formation of cytoplasmic translation initiation complex [GO:0001732]","IRES-dependent viral translational initiation [GO:0075522]","negative regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade [GO:0070373]","translational initiation [GO:0006413]","translation reinitiation [GO:0002188]","viral translational termination-reinitiation [GO:0075525]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["mRNA binding [GO:0003729]","receptor tyrosine kinase binding [GO:0030971]","RNA binding [GO:0003723]","structural molecule activity [GO:0005198]","translation initiation factor activity [GO:0003743]"]}},"context":{}}

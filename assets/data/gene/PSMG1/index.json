The PSMG1-PSMG2 heterodimer binds to the PSMA5 and PSMA7 proteasome subunits, promotes assembly of the proteasome alpha subunits into the heteroheptameric alpha ring and prevents alpha ring dimerization. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251969, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17707236}.","keywords":["Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Chaperone","Cytoplasm","Endoplasmic reticulum","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.

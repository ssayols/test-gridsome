The small ribosomal subunit (SSU) binds messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and translates the encoded message by selecting cognate aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules (Probable). The large subunit (LSU) contains the ribosomal catalytic site termed the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), which catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds, thereby polymerizing the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into a polypeptide chain (Probable). The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel (Probable). As part of the LSU, it is probably required for its formation and the maturation of rRNAs (PubMed:31630789). Plays a role in bone development (PubMed:31630789). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23636399, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31630789, ECO:0000305}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Disease mutation","Dwarfism","Isopeptide bond","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ribonucleoprotein","Ribosomal protein","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000305|PubMed:31630789}.","domain":"","geneNames":["RPL13","BBC1","OK/SW-cl.46"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]","cytosolic large ribosomal subunit [GO:0022625]","cytosolic ribosome [GO:0022626]","endoplasmic reticulum [GO:0005783]","membrane [GO:0016020]","nucleolus [GO:0005730]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process, nonsense-mediated decay [GO:0000184]","SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane [GO:0006614]","translation [GO:0006412]","translational initiation [GO:0006413]","viral transcription [GO:0019083]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["RNA binding [GO:0003723]","structural constituent of ribosome [GO:0003735]"]}},"context":{}}

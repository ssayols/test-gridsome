Promotes heterochromatin formation in both autosomes and chromosome X, probably by mediating the merge of chromatin compartments (By similarity). Plays a key role in chromosome X inactivation in females by promoting the spreading of heterochromatin (PubMed:23542155). Recruited to inactivated chromosome X by Xist RNA and acts by mediating the merge of chromatin compartments: promotes random chromatin interactions that span the boundaries of existing structures, leading to create a compartment-less architecture typical of inactivated chromosome X (By similarity). Required to facilitate Xist RNA spreading (By similarity). Also required for silencing of a subset of clustered autosomal loci in somatic cells, such as the DUX4 locus (PubMed:23143600). Has ATPase activity; may participate in structural manipulation of chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner as part of its role in gene expression regulation (PubMed:29748383). Also plays a role in DNA repair: localizes to sites of DNA double-strand breaks in response to DNA damage to promote the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (PubMed:25294876, PubMed:24790221). Acts by promoting non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and inhibiting homologous recombination (HR) repair (PubMed:25294876). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6P5D8, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23143600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23542155, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24790221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25294876, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29748383}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Chromatin regulator","Chromosome","DNA damage","DNA repair","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Hydrolase","Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism","Isopeptide bond","Kallmann syndrome","Microphthalmia","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Chromosome {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24790221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25294876}.

The eIF-3 complex associates with the 40S ribosome and facilitates the recruitment of eIF-1, eIF-1A, eIF-2:GTP:methionyl-tRNAi and eIF-5 to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC). The eIF-3 complex stimulates mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC and scanning of the mRNA for AUG recognition. The eIF-3 complex is also required for disassembly and recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes and subsequently prevents premature joining of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits prior to initiation (PubMed:17581632). The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, and uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression (PubMed:25849773). {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03011, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17581632, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25849773, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27462815}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) In case of FCV infection, plays a role in the ribosomal termination-reinitiation event leading to the translation of VP2 (PubMed:18056426). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18056426}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Initiation factor","Phosphoprotein","Protein biosynthesis","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03011}.","domain":"DOMAIN 331..537;  /note=\"PCI\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU01185\"","geneNames":["EIF3L","EIF3EIP","EIF3S6IP","HSPC021","HSPC025","MSTP005"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]","eukaryotic 43S preinitiation complex [GO:0016282]","eukaryotic 48S preinitiation complex [GO:0033290]","eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 complex [GO:0005852]","fibrillar center [GO:0001650]","membrane [GO:0016020]","nucleoplasm [GO:0005654]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["formation of cytoplasmic translation initiation complex [GO:0001732]","translational initiation [GO:0006413]","viral translational termination-reinitiation [GO:0075525]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["RNA binding [GO:0003723]","translation initiation factor activity [GO:0003743]"]}},"context":{}}

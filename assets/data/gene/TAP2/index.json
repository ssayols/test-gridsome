Also acts as a molecular scaffold for the final stage of MHC class I folding, namely the binding of peptide. Nascent MHC class I molecules associate with TAP via tapasin. Inhibited by the covalent attachment of herpes simplex virus ICP47 protein, which blocks the peptide-binding site of TAP. Inhibited by human cytomegalovirus US6 glycoprotein, which binds to the lumenal side of the TAP complex and inhibits peptide translocation by specifically blocking ATP-binding to TAP1 and prevents the conformational rearrangement of TAP induced by peptide binding. Inhibited by human adenovirus E3-19K glycoprotein, which binds the TAP complex and acts as a tapasin inhibitor, preventing MHC class I/TAP association.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Adaptive immunity","Alternative splicing","Endoplasmic reticulum","Host-virus interaction","Immunity","Membrane","Nucleotide-binding","Peptide transport","Polymorphism","Protein transport","Reference proteome","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix","Transport"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Multi-pass membrane protein.

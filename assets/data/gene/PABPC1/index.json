Its function in translational initiation regulation can either be enhanced by PAIP1 or repressed by PAIP2 (PubMed:11051545, PubMed:20573744). Can probably bind to cytoplasmic RNA sequences other than poly(A) in vivo. Involved in translationally coupled mRNA turnover (PubMed:11051545). Implicated with other RNA-binding proteins in the cytoplasmic deadenylation/translational and decay interplay of the FOS mRNA mediated by the major coding-region determinant of instability (mCRD) domain (PubMed:11051545). Involved in regulation of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of mRNAs containing premature stop codons; for the recognition of premature termination codons (PTC) and initiation of NMD a competitive interaction between UPF1 and PABPC1 with the ribosome-bound release factors is proposed (PubMed:18447585). By binding to long poly(A) tails, may protect them from uridylation by ZCCHC6/ZCCHC11 and hence contribute to mRNA stability (PubMed:25480299). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11051545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17212783, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18447585, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20573744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25480299}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Positively regulates the replication of dengue virus (DENV). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26735137}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cell projection","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Methylation","Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Repeat","Spliceosome","mRNA processing","mRNA splicing"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20573744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21883093, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28733330, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7908267, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9582337}.

Promotes the exchange of GDP to GTP, converting inactive GDP-bound RAB12 into its active GTP-bound form (PubMed:20937701). Regulates autophagy in response to starvation through RAB12 activation. Starvation leads to ULK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-472 and Ser-490, which in turn allows recruitment of 14-3-3 adapter proteins and leads to up-regulation of GEF activity towards RAB12 (By similarity). Also plays a role in protein transport from recycling endosomes to lysosomes, regulating, for instance, the degradation of the transferrin receptor and of the amino acid transporter PAT4 (PubMed:20937701). Starvation also induces phosphorylation at Tyr-858, which leads to up-regulated GEF activity and initiates autophagy (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:A2RT67, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20937701}.","keywords":["Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Guanine-nucleotide releasing factor","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Repeat","WD repeat"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:A2RT67}.

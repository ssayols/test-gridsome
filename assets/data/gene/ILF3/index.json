Within the nucleus, promotes circRNAs processing by stabilizing the regulatory elements residing in the flanking introns of the circularized exons. Plays thereby a role in the back-splicing of a subset of circRNAs (PubMed:28625552). As a consequence, participates in a wide range of transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. Binds to poly-U elements and AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3'-UTR of target mRNAs (PubMed:14731398). Upon viral infection, ILF3 accumulates in the cytoplasm and participates in the innate antiviral response (PubMed:21123651). Mechanistically, ILF3 becomes phosphorylated and activated by the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase/PKR which releases ILF3 from cellular mature circRNAs. In turn, unbound ILF3 molecules are able to interact with and thus inhibit viral mRNAs (PubMed:21123651, PubMed:28625552). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14731398, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21123651, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28625552, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9442054}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Antiviral defense","Cytoplasm","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Isopeptide bond","Methylation","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Repeat","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus, nucleolus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26240280}.

Note=Localizes in the cytoplasm in response to viral infection. The unphosphorylated form is retained in the nucleus by ILF2. Phosphorylation at Thr-188 and Thr-315 causes the dissociation of ILF2 from the ILF2-ILF3 complex resulting in a cytoplasmic sequestration of ILF3.

Component of steroid receptors heterocomplexes through interaction with heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90). May play a role in the intracellular trafficking of heterooligomeric forms of steroid hormone receptors between cytoplasm and nuclear compartments. The isomerase activity controls neuronal growth cones via regulation of TRPC1 channel opening. Acts also as a regulator of microtubule dynamics by inhibiting MAPT/TAU ability to promote microtubule assembly. May have a protective role against oxidative stress in mitochondria. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1279700, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1376003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19945390, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21730050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2378870}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Cell projection","Chaperone","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Direct protein sequencing","Isomerase","Isopeptide bond","Methylation","Microtubule","Mitochondrion","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Repeat","Rotamase","TPR repeat","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:2378870}.

Forms a complex with EIF2AK4/GCN2 on translating ribosomes; during this process, GCN1 seems to act as a chaperone to facilitate delivery of uncharged tRNAs that enter the A site of ribosomes to the tRNA-binding domain of EIF2AK4/GCN2, and hence stimulating EIF2AK4/GCN2 kinase activity. Participates in the repression of global protein synthesis and in gene-specific mRNA translation activation, such as the transcriptional activator ATF4, by promoting the EIF2AK4/GCN2-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF-2-alpha/EIF2S1) on 'Ser-52', and hence allowing ATF4-mediated reprogramming of amino acid biosynthetic gene expression to alleviate nutrient depletion. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:E9PVA8, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P33892}.","keywords":["Acetylation","Activator","Coiled coil","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Repeat","Stress response","Translation regulation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:E9PVA8}.

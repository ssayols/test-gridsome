Interacts with COPS5 and restores COPS5-induced suppression of CDKN1B stability, blocking the COPS5-mediated translocation of CDKN1B from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Functions as a transcriptional repressor, possibly by acting as a bridge molecule between transcription factors and corepressor complexes, and over-expression will induce G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Required for the maturation of natural killer cells. Acts as a suppressor of tumor cell growth. Inhibits the proteasomal degradation of DDIT4, and thereby contributes to the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12821938, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17603038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18541147, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21460850}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Cell cycle","Cytoplasm","Disulfide bond","Isopeptide bond","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Tumor suppressor","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250}.","domain":"","geneNames":["TXNIP","VDUP1"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","mitochondrial intermembrane space [GO:0005758]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cell cycle [GO:0007049]","cellular response to tumor cell [GO:0071228]","keratinocyte differentiation [GO:0030216]","negative regulation of cell division [GO:0051782]","negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0000122]","platelet-derived growth factor receptor signaling pathway [GO:0048008]","positive regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043065]","protein import into nucleus [GO:0006606]","regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0042127]","response to calcium ion [GO:0051592]","response to estradiol [GO:0032355]","response to glucose [GO:0009749]","response to hydrogen peroxide [GO:0042542]","response to mechanical stimulus [GO:0009612]","response to progesterone [GO:0032570]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["enzyme inhibitor activity [GO:0004857]","ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]"]}},"context":{}}

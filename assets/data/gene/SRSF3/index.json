Interaction with YTHDC1, a RNA-binding protein that recognizes and binds N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-containing RNAs, promotes recruitment of SRSF3 to its mRNA-binding elements adjacent to m6A sites, leading to exon-inclusion during alternative splicing (PubMed:26876937). Also functions as export adapter involved in mRNA nuclear export (PubMed:11336712, PubMed:18364396, PubMed:28984244). Binds mRNA which is thought to be transferred to the NXF1-NXT1 heterodimer for export (TAP/NXF1 pathway); enhances NXF1-NXT1 RNA-binding activity (PubMed:11336712, PubMed:18364396). Involved in nuclear export of m6A-containing mRNAs via interaction with YTHDC1: interaction with YTHDC1 facilitates m6A-containing mRNA-binding to both SRSF3 and NXF1, promoting mRNA nuclear export (PubMed:28984244). RNA-binding is semi-sequence specific (PubMed:17036044). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11336712, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17036044, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18364396, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26876937, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28984244}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Repeat","Transport","mRNA processing","mRNA splicing","mRNA transport"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11336712}.

Participates in the DNA-triggered cGAS/STING pathway by promoting the DNA binding and activation of CGAS. Enhances also DDX58-induced type I interferon production probably by helping DDX58 at sensing pathogenic RNA (PubMed:30804210). In addition, plays an essential role in stress granule formation (PubMed:12642610, PubMed:20180778, PubMed:23279204). Unwinds preferentially partial DNA and RNA duplexes having a 17 bp annealed portion and either a hanging 3' tail or hanging tails at both 5'- and 3'-ends (PubMed:9889278). Unwinds DNA/DNA, RNA/DNA, and RNA/RNA substrates with comparable efficiency (PubMed:9889278). Acts unidirectionally by moving in the 5' to 3' direction along the bound single-stranded DNA (PubMed:9889278). Phosphorylation-dependent sequence-specific endoribonuclease in vitro (PubMed:11604510). Cleaves exclusively between cytosine and adenine and cleaves MYC mRNA preferentially at the 3'-UTR (PubMed:11604510). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11604510, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12642610, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20180778, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23279204, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30510222, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30804210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9889278}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Endonuclease","Helicase","Host-virus interaction","Hydrolase","Immunity","Innate immunity","Isopeptide bond","Methylation","Nuclease","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Transport","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20180778, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30510222}.

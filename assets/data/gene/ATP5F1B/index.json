F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core, and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation. Subunits alpha and beta form the catalytic core in F(1). Rotation of the central stalk against the surrounding alpha(3)beta(3) subunits leads to hydrolysis of ATP in three separate catalytic sites on the beta subunits.","keywords":["ATP synthesis","ATP-binding","Acetylation","CF(1)","Direct protein sequencing","Glycoprotein","Hydrogen ion transport","Ion transport","Membrane","Mitochondrion","Mitochondrion inner membrane","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Transit peptide","Translocase","Transport"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion inner membrane {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P00829}; Peripheral membrane protein {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P00829}; Matrix side {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P00829}.","domain":"","geneNames":["ATP5F1B","ATP5B","ATPMB","ATPSB"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cell [GO:0005623]","cell surface [GO:0009986]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","membrane [GO:0016020]","mitochondrial matrix [GO:0005759]","mitochondrial membrane [GO:0031966]","mitochondrial nucleoid [GO:0042645]","mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP synthase, catalytic core [GO:0005754]","mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP synthase complex [GO:0005753]","mitochondrion [GO:0005739]","nucleus [GO:0005634]","plasma membrane [GO:0005886]","proton-transporting ATP synthase complex [GO:0045259]","proton-transporting ATP synthase complex, catalytic core F(1) [GO:0045261]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["angiogenesis [GO:0001525]","ATP biosynthetic process [GO:0006754]","cellular response to interleukin-7 [GO:0098761]","cristae formation [GO:0042407]","generation of precursor metabolites and energy [GO:0006091]","lipid metabolic process [GO:0006629]","mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled proton transport [GO:0042776]","mitochondrion organization [GO:0007005]","negative regulation of cell adhesion involved in substrate-bound cell migration [GO:0006933]","osteoblast differentiation [GO:0001649]","positive regulation of blood vessel endothelial cell migration [GO:0043536]","proton transmembrane transport [GO:1902600]","regulation of intracellular pH [GO:0051453]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["angiostatin binding [GO:0043532]","ATP binding [GO:0005524]","MHC class I protein binding [GO:0042288]","proton-transporting ATPase activity, rotational mechanism [GO:0046961]","proton-transporting ATP synthase activity, rotational mechanism [GO:0046933]"]}},"context":{}}

At high concentrations, profilin prevents the polymerization of actin, whereas it enhances it at low concentrations. By binding to PIP2, it inhibits the formation of IP3 and DG. Inhibits androgen receptor (AR) and HTT aggregation and binding of G-actin is essential for its inhibition of AR. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18573880}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Actin-binding","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Isopeptide bond","Neurodegeneration","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton.","domain":"","geneNames":["PFN1"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["blood microparticle [GO:0072562]","cell cortex [GO:0005938]","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytoskeleton [GO:0005856]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","focal adhesion [GO:0005925]","glutamatergic synapse [GO:0098978]","membrane [GO:0016020]","nucleus [GO:0005634]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["actin cytoskeleton organization [GO:0030036]","modification of postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton [GO:0098885]","negative regulation of actin filament bundle assembly [GO:0032232]","negative regulation of actin filament polymerization [GO:0030837]","negative regulation of stress fiber assembly [GO:0051497]","neural tube closure [GO:0001843]","positive regulation of actin filament bundle assembly [GO:0032233]","positive regulation of actin filament polymerization [GO:0030838]","positive regulation of ATPase activity [GO:0032781]","positive regulation of epithelial cell migration [GO:0010634]","positive regulation of ruffle assembly [GO:1900029]","protein stabilization [GO:0050821]","regulation of actin filament polymerization [GO:0030833]","regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0006357]","synapse maturation [GO:0060074]","Wnt signaling pathway, planar cell polarity pathway [GO:0060071]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["actin binding [GO:0003779]","actin monomer binding [GO:0003785]","adenyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity [GO:0000774]","cadherin binding [GO:0045296]","phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding [GO:0005546]","phosphotyrosine residue binding [GO:0001784]","proline-rich region binding [GO:0070064]","Rho GTPase binding [GO:0017048]","RNA binding [GO:0003723]"]}},"context":{}}

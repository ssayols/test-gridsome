Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different set of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (PubMed:9437002). Plays a role in the initial events of the autophagic vacuole development which take place at specialized regions of the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:20545908). Regulates vesicular transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and successive Golgi compartments (By similarity). Promotes the recruitment of lipid phosphatase MTMR6 to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P10536, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20545908, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9437002}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Autophagy","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","GTP-binding","Lipoprotein","Membrane","Methylation","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Prenylation","Protein transport","Reference proteome","Transport"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11389151}.

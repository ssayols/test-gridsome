Functions as an E3 ligase for oxidized IREB2 and both heme and oxygen are necessary for IREB2 ubiquitination. Promotes ubiquitination of TAB2 and IRF3 and their degradation by the proteasome. Component of the LUBAC complex which conjugates linear ('Met-1'-linked) polyubiquitin chains to substrates and plays a key role in NF-kappa-B activation and regulation of inflammation. LUBAC conjugates linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and RIPK1 and is involved in activation of the canonical NF-kappa-B and the JNK signaling pathways. Linear ubiquitination mediated by the LUBAC complex interferes with TNF-induced cell death and thereby prevents inflammation. LUBAC is recruited to the TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC) following polyubiquitination of TNF-RSC components by BIRC2 and/or BIRC3 and to conjugate linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and possibly other components contributing to the stability of the complex. Together with OTULIN, the LUBAC complex regulates the canonical Wnt signaling during angiogenesis. Binds polyubiquitin of different linkage types. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12629548, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17006537, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17449468, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18711448, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19136968, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20005846, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21455173, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21455180, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21455181}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Coiled coil","Disease mutation","Host-virus interaction","Metal-binding","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Repeat","Transferase","Ubl conjugation","Ubl conjugation pathway","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"","domain":"DOMAIN 55..119;  /note=\"Ubiquitin-like\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00214\"","geneNames":["RBCK1","C20orf18","RNF54","UBCE7IP3","XAP3","XAP4"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cytosol [GO:0005829]","LUBAC complex [GO:0071797]","ubiquitin ligase complex [GO:0000151]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:0007249]","negative regulation of necroptotic process [GO:0060546]","negative regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity [GO:0032088]","positive regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:2001238]","positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:0043123]","positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity [GO:0051092]","positive regulation of NIK/NF-kappaB signaling [GO:1901224]","proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process [GO:0043161]","protein linear polyubiquitination [GO:0097039]","protein polyubiquitination [GO:0000209]","regulation of transcription, DNA-templated [GO:0006355]","regulation of tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0010803]","T cell receptor signaling pathway [GO:0050852]","viral process [GO:0016032]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["identical protein binding [GO:0042802]","metal ion binding [GO:0046872]","ubiquitin binding [GO:0043130]","ubiquitin-protein transferase activity [GO:0004842]"]}},"context":{}}

Involved in the uptake of single-stranded oligonucleotides by living cells, a process called gymnosis (PubMed:28277980). In vitro, mediates the uptake of linear DNA more efficiently than that of circular DNA, but exhibits similar uptake efficacy toward RNA and DNA. Binds long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (500 - 700 base pairs), but not dsRNA shorter than 100 bp (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8CIF6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27046251, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27846365, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28277980}.","keywords":["Alternative splicing","Cell membrane","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Glycoprotein","Lysosome","Membrane","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Signal","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix","Transport"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Lysosome membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17897319, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28277980}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17897319}.

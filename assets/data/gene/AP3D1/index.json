The complex is associated with the Golgi region as well as more peripheral structures. It facilitates the budding of vesicles from the Golgi membrane and may be directly involved in trafficking to lysosomes. Involved in process of CD8+ T-cell and NK cell degranulation (PubMed:26744459). In concert with the BLOC-1 complex, AP-3 is required to target cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O54774, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26744459}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Albinism","Alternative splicing","Coiled coil","Cytoplasm","Golgi apparatus","Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome","Membrane","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Protein transport","Reference proteome","Repeat","Transport"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250}.

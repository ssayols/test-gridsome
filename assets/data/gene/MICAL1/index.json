In the absence of actin, it also functions as a NADPH oxidase producing H(2)O(2) (PubMed:21864500, PubMed:26845023). Acts as a cytoskeletal regulator that connects NEDD9 to intermediate filaments. Also acts as a negative regulator of apoptosis via its interaction with STK38 and STK38L; acts by antagonizing STK38 and STK38L activation by MST1/STK4. Involved in regulation of lamina-specific connectivity in the nervous system such as the development of lamina-restricted hippocampal connections. Through redox regulation of the actin cytoskeleton controls the intracellular distribution of secretory vesicles containing L1/neurofascin/NgCAM family proteins in neurons, thereby regulating their cell surface levels (By similarity). May act as Rab effector protein and play a role in vesicle trafficking. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8VDP3, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18305261, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21864500, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26845023, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28230050, ECO:0000305, ECO:0000305|PubMed:27552051}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Actin-binding","Alternative splicing","Coiled coil","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","FAD","Flavoprotein","LIM domain","Metal-binding","Monooxygenase","NADP","Oxidoreductase","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Zinc"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.

Part of a ternary complex that binds to the downstream control sequence (DCS) of the pre-mRNA. Mediates exon inclusion in transcripts that are subject to tissue-specific alternative splicing. May interact with single-stranded DNA from the far-upstream element (FUSE). May activate gene expression. Also involved in degradation of inherently unstable mRNAs that contain AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3'-UTR, possibly by recruiting degradation machinery to ARE-containing mRNAs. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11003644, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8940189, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9136930}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Cytoplasm","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Isopeptide bond","Methylation","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Repeat","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Transport","Ubl conjugation","mRNA processing","mRNA splicing","mRNA transport"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19198587}.

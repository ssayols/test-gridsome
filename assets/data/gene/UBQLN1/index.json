Mediates the proteasomal targeting of misfolded or accumulated proteins for degradation by binding (via UBA domain) to their polyubiquitin chains and by interacting (via ubiquitin-like domain) with the subunits of the proteasome (PubMed:15147878). Plays a role in the ERAD pathway via its interaction with ER-localized proteins UBXN4, VCP and HERPUD1 and may form a link between the polyubiquitinated ERAD substrates and the proteasome (PubMed:19822669, PubMed:18307982). Isoform 1, isoform 2 and isoform 3 play a role in unfolded protein response (UPR) by attenuating the induction of UPR-inducible genes, DDTI3/CHOP, HSPA5 and PDIA2 during ER stress (PubMed:18953672). Involved in the regulation of macroautophagy and autophagosome formation; required for maturation of autophagy-related protein LC3 from the cytosolic form LC3-I to the membrane-bound form LC3-II and may assist in the maturation of autophagosomes to autolysosomes by mediating autophagosome-lysosome fusion (PubMed:19148225, PubMed:20529957, PubMed:23459205). Negatively regulates the TICAM1/TRIF-dependent toll-like receptor signaling pathway by decreasing the abundance of TICAM1 via the autophagic pathway (PubMed:21695056). Isoform 1 and isoform 3 play a key role in the regulation of the levels of PSEN1 by targeting its accumulation to aggresomes which may then be removed from cells by autophagocytosis (PubMed:21143716). Promotes the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of ORAI1, consequently downregulating the ORAI1-mediated Ca2+ mobilization (PubMed:23307288). Suppresses the maturation and proteasomal degradation of amyloid beta A4 protein (A4) by stimulating the lysine 63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination. Delays the maturation of A4 by sequestering it in the Golgi apparatus and preventing its transport to the cell surface for subsequent processing (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9JJP9, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18307982, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18953672, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19148225, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19822669, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20529957, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21143716, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21695056, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23307288, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23459205, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15147878}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Autophagy","Cell membrane","Cytoplasm","Cytoplasmic vesicle","Direct protein sequencing","Endoplasmic reticulum","Membrane","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Proteasome","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16159959, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23979357}.

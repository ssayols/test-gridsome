During immune responses, required for interstitial dendritic cell (DC) migration by locally activating CDC42 at the leading edge membrane of DC (By similarity). Required for CD4(+) T-cell migration in response to chemokine stimulation by promoting CDC42 activation at T cell leading edge membrane (PubMed:28028151). Is involved in NK cell cytotoxicity by controlling polarization of microtubule-organizing center (MTOC), and possibly regulating CCDC88B-mediated lytic granule transport to MTOC during cell killing (PubMed:25762780). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8C147, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22461490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25762780, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28028151}.","keywords":["Alternative splicing","Cell membrane","Cell projection","Chromosomal rearrangement","Cytoplasm","Disease mutation","Guanine-nucleotide releasing factor","Membrane","Mental retardation","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:28028151}.

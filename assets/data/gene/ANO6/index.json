Phospholipid scrambling results in surface exposure of phosphatidylserine which in platelets is essential to trigger the clotting system whereas in osteoblasts is essential for the deposition of hydroxyapatite during bone mineralization. Has calcium-dependent phospholipid scramblase activity; scrambles phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine and galactosylceramide (By similarity). Can generate outwardly rectifying chloride channel currents in airway epithelial cells and Jurkat T lymphocytes. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6P9J9, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20056604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21107324, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21908539, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22006324, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22946059}.","keywords":["Alternative splicing","Calcium","Cell membrane","Chloride","Chloride channel","Disulfide bond","Glycoprotein","Ion channel","Ion transport","Lipid transport","Membrane","Metal-binding","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix","Transport","Voltage-gated channel"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20056604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21107324, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22075693, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22946059}; Multi-pass membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20056604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21107324, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22075693, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22946059}.

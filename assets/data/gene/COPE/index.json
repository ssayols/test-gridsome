The coatomer complex is required for budding from Golgi membranes, and is essential for the retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport of dilysine-tagged proteins. In mammals, the coatomer can only be recruited by membranes associated with ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), which are small GTP-binding proteins; the complex also influences the Golgi structural integrity, as well as the processing, activity, and endocytic recycling of LDL receptors (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Cytoplasmic vesicle","Direct protein sequencing","ER-Golgi transport","Golgi apparatus","Membrane","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Protein transport","Reference proteome","Transport","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250}.

Plays a role in the alternative splicing of MAPT/Tau exon 10. Binds to alternative exons of TNC pre-mRNA and promotes the expression of alternatively spliced TNC. Plays a role in wound healing and in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation via its role in alternative splicing. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12549914, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15009664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22767602, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24440982}.","keywords":["Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Direct protein sequencing","Isopeptide bond","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","RNA-binding","Reference proteome","Repeat","Repressor","Ubl conjugation","mRNA processing","mRNA splicing"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12549914, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22767602}.

Regulates glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse development (By similarity). Promotes the development of inhibitory synapses in a PLXNB1-dependent manner and promotes the development of excitatory synapses in a PLXNB2-dependent manner (By similarity). Plays a role in priming antigen-specific T-cells, promotes differentiation of Th1 T-helper cells, and thereby contributes to adaptive immunity (By similarity). Promotes phosphorylation of TIMD2 (By similarity). Inhibits angiogenesis (By similarity). Promotes axon growth cone collapse (By similarity). Inhibits axonal extension by providing local signals to specify territories inaccessible for growing axons (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q62178}.","keywords":["Adaptive immunity","Alternative splicing","Angiogenesis","Cell membrane","Cone-rod dystrophy","Developmental protein","Differentiation","Disease mutation","Disulfide bond","Glycoprotein","Immunity","Immunoglobulin domain","Membrane","Neurogenesis","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Retinitis pigmentosa","Signal","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22956603}; Single-pass type I membrane protein {ECO:0000255}.","domain":"DOMAIN 36..494;  /note=\"Sema\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00352\"; DOMAIN 496..548;  /note=\"PSI\"; DOMAIN 573..631;  /note=\"Ig-like C2-type\"","geneNames":["SEMA4A","SEMAB","SEMB","UNQ783/PRO1317"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["extracellular space [GO:0005615]","integral component of plasma membrane [GO:0005887]","plasma membrane [GO:0005886]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["angiogenesis [GO:0001525]","axonogenesis [GO:0007409]","negative chemotaxis [GO:0050919]","negative regulation of angiogenesis [GO:0016525]","negative regulation of axon extension involved in axon guidance [GO:0048843]","neural crest cell migration [GO:0001755]","positive regulation of cell migration [GO:0030335]","positive regulation of excitatory synapse assembly [GO:1904891]","positive regulation of inhibitory synapse assembly [GO:1905704]","regulation of cell shape [GO:0008360]","regulation of endothelial cell migration [GO:0010594]","semaphorin-plexin signaling pathway [GO:0071526]","T-helper 1 cell differentiation [GO:0045063]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["chemorepellent activity [GO:0045499]","semaphorin receptor binding [GO:0030215]"]}},"context":{}}

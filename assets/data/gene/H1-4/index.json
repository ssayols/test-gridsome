Histones H1 are necessary for the condensation of nucleosome chains into higher-order structured fibers. Acts also as a regulator of individual gene transcription through chromatin remodeling, nucleosome spacing and DNA methylation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ADP-ribosylation","Acetylation","Chromosome","Citrullination","DNA-binding","Direct protein sequencing","Hydroxylation","Mental retardation","Methylation","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.

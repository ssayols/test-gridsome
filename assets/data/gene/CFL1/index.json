Regulates actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Important for normal progress through mitosis and normal cytokinesis. Plays a role in the regulation of cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization. Required for the up-regulation of atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2 from endosomal compartment to cell membrane, increasing its efficiency in chemokine uptake and degradation (PubMed:11812157, PubMed:15580268, PubMed:21834987, PubMed:23633677). Required for neural tube morphogenesis and neural crest cell migration (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P18760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11812157, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15580268, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21834987, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23633677}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Actin-binding","Cell membrane","Cell projection","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Direct protein sequencing","Isopeptide bond","Membrane","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus matrix {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15580268}.

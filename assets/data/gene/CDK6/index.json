Phosphorylates pRB/RB1 and NPM1. Interacts with D-type G1 cyclins during interphase at G1 to form a pRB/RB1 kinase and controls the entrance into the cell cycle. Involved in initiation and maintenance of cell cycle exit during cell differentiation; prevents cell proliferation and regulates negatively cell differentiation, but is required for the proliferation of specific cell types (e.g. erythroid and hematopoietic cells). Essential for cell proliferation within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles. Required during thymocyte development. Promotes the production of newborn neurons, probably by modulating G1 length. Promotes, at least in astrocytes, changes in patterns of gene expression, changes in the actin cytoskeleton including loss of stress fibers, and enhanced motility during cell differentiation. Prevents myeloid differentiation by interfering with RUNX1 and reducing its transcription transactivation activity, but promotes proliferation of normal myeloid progenitors. Delays senescence. Promotes the proliferation of beta-cells in pancreatic islets of Langerhans. May play a role in the centrosome organization during the cell cycle phases (PubMed:23918663). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12833137, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14985467, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15254224, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15809340, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17420273, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17431401, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20333249, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20668294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23918663, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8114739}.","keywords":["3D-structure","ATP-binding","Acetylation","Cell cycle","Cell division","Cell projection","Cytoplasm","Cytoskeleton","Differentiation","Disease mutation","Kinase","Nucleotide-binding","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Primary microcephaly","Reference proteome","Serine/threonine-protein kinase","Transferase"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.

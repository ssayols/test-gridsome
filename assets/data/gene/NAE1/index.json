E1 activates NEDD8 by first adenylating its C-terminal glycine residue with ATP, thereafter linking this residue to the side chain of the catalytic cysteine, yielding a NEDD8-UBA3 thioester and free AMP. E1 finally transfers NEDD8 to the catalytic cysteine of UBE2M. Necessary for cell cycle progression through the S-M checkpoint. Overexpression of NAE1 causes apoptosis through deregulation of NEDD8 conjugation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10207026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10722740, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12740388}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Apoptosis","Cell cycle","Cell membrane","Membrane","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation","Ubl conjugation pathway"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14557245}.

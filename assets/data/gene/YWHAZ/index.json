Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner. Induces ARHGEF7 activity on RAC1 as well as lamellipodia and membrane ruffle formation (PubMed:16959763). In neurons, regulates spine maturation through the modulation of ARHGEF7 activity (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O55043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14578935, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15071501, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15644438, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16376338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16959763, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31024343, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9360956}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Alternative splicing","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17081065}.

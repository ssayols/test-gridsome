In its active state, binds to a variety of effector proteins to regulate cellular responses such as secretory processes, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, epithelial cell polarization, neurons adhesion, migration and differentiation, and growth-factor induced formation of membrane ruffles (PubMed:1643658, PubMed:28886345). Rac1 p21/rho GDI heterodimer is the active component of the cytosolic factor sigma 1, which is involved in stimulation of the NADPH oxidase activity in macrophages. Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly. Stimulates PKN2 kinase activity (PubMed:9121475). In concert with RAB7A, plays a role in regulating the formation of RBs (ruffled borders) in osteoclasts (PubMed:1643658). In podocytes, promotes nuclear shuttling of NR3C2; this modulation is required for a proper kidney functioning. Required for atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2-induced LIMK1-PAK1-dependent phosphorylation of cofilin (CFL1) and for up-regulation of ACKR2 from endosomal compartment to cell membrane, increasing its efficiency in chemokine uptake and degradation. In neurons, is involved in dendritic spine formation and synaptic plasticity (By similarity). In synapses, seems to mediate the regulation of F-actin cluster formation performed by SHANK3. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P63001, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6RUV5, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1643658, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28886345, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9121475}.; FUNCTION: Isoform B has an accelerated GEF-independent GDP/GTP exchange and an impaired GTP hydrolysis, which is restored partially by GTPase-activating proteins. It is able to bind to the GTPase-binding domain of PAK but not full-length PAK in a GTP-dependent manner, suggesting that the insertion does not completely abolish effector interaction.","keywords":["3D-structure","ADP-ribosylation","Alternative splicing","Cell membrane","Cell projection","Cytoplasm","Disease mutation","GTP-binding","Glycoprotein","Hydrolase","Isopeptide bond","Lipoprotein","Membrane","Mental retardation","Methylation","Nucleotide-binding","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Prenylation","Reference proteome","Ubl conjugation"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1643658}; Lipid-anchor {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1903399}; Cytoplasmic side {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1643658, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19948726}.

Identified by mass spectrometry in melanosome fractions from stage I to stage IV (PubMed:17081065). Found in the ruffled border (a late endosomal-like compartment in the plasma membrane) of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Localizes to the lamellipodium in a SH3RF1-dependent manner (By similarity). In macrophages, cytoplasmic location increases upon CSF1 stimulation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P63001, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6RUV5, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17081065, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1903399}.","domain":"","geneNames":["RAC1","TC25","MIG5"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cell cortex [GO:0005938]","cell projection [GO:0042995]","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granule [GO:0036464]","cytoplasmic vesicle [GO:0031410]","cytoskeleton [GO:0005856]","cytosol [GO:0005829]","dendritic spine [GO:0043197]","endoplasmic reticulum membrane [GO:0005789]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","ficolin-1-rich granule membrane [GO:0101003]","focal adhesion [GO:0005925]","glutamatergic synapse [GO:0098978]","Golgi membrane [GO:0000139]","intracellular membrane-bounded organelle [GO:0043231]","lamellipodium [GO:0030027]","melanosome [GO:0042470]","membrane [GO:0016020]","plasma membrane [GO:0005886]","postsynapse [GO:0098794]","recycling endosome membrane [GO:0055038]","ruffle membrane [GO:0032587]","secretory granule membrane [GO:0030667]","trans-Golgi network [GO:0005802]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["actin cytoskeleton organization [GO:0030036]","actin filament organization [GO:0007015]","actin filament polymerization [GO:0030041]","anatomical structure morphogenesis [GO:0009653]","blood coagulation [GO:0007596]","bone resorption [GO:0045453]","cell adhesion [GO:0007155]","cell-matrix adhesion [GO:0007160]","cell motility [GO:0048870]","cell population proliferation [GO:0008283]","cell projection assembly [GO:0030031]","cellular response to mechanical stimulus [GO:0071260]","cortical cytoskeleton organization [GO:0030865]","engulfment of apoptotic cell [GO:0043652]","ephrin receptor signaling pathway [GO:0048013]","establishment or maintenance of cell polarity [GO:0007163]","Fc-epsilon receptor signaling pathway [GO:0038095]","Fc-gamma receptor signaling pathway involved in phagocytosis [GO:0038096]","hepatocyte growth factor receptor signaling pathway [GO:0048012]","inflammatory response [GO:0006954]","intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]","lamellipodium assembly [GO:0030032]","localization within membrane [GO:0051668]","mast cell chemotaxis [GO:0002551]","motor neuron axon guidance [GO:0008045]","negative regulation of interleukin-23 production [GO:0032707]","negative regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis [GO:0048261]","neuron migration [GO:0001764]","neutrophil degranulation [GO:0043312]","positive regulation of cell-substrate adhesion [GO:0010811]","positive regulation of DNA replication [GO:0045740]","positive regulation of focal adhesion assembly [GO:0051894]","positive regulation of insulin secretion involved in cellular response to glucose stimulus [GO:0035774]","positive regulation of lamellipodium assembly [GO:0010592]","positive regulation of microtubule polymerization [GO:0031116]","positive regulation of neutrophil chemotaxis [GO:0090023]","positive regulation of protein kinase B signaling [GO:0051897]","positive regulation of protein phosphorylation [GO:0001934]","positive regulation of Rho protein signal transduction [GO:0035025]","positive regulation of stress fiber assembly [GO:0051496]","positive regulation of substrate adhesion-dependent cell spreading [GO:1900026]","Rac protein signal transduction [GO:0016601]","regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization [GO:0032956]","regulation of cell migration [GO:0030334]","regulation of cell shape [GO:0008360]","regulation of cell size [GO:0008361]","regulation of defense response to virus by virus [GO:0050690]","regulation of hydrogen peroxide metabolic process [GO:0010310]","regulation of lamellipodium assembly [GO:0010591]","regulation of neutrophil migration [GO:1902622]","regulation of nitric oxide biosynthetic process [GO:0045428]","regulation of respiratory burst [GO:0060263]","regulation of small GTPase mediated signal transduction [GO:0051056]","regulation of stress fiber assembly [GO:0051492]","response to wounding [GO:0009611]","Rho protein signal transduction [GO:0007266]","ruffle assembly [GO:0097178]","ruffle organization [GO:0031529]","semaphorin-plexin signaling pathway [GO:0071526]","substrate adhesion-dependent cell spreading [GO:0034446]","T cell costimulation [GO:0031295]","vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling pathway [GO:0048010]","Wnt signaling pathway, planar cell polarity pathway [GO:0060071]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["ATPase binding [GO:0051117]","enzyme binding [GO:0019899]","GTPase activity [GO:0003924]","GTP binding [GO:0005525]","histone deacetylase binding [GO:0042826]","protein-containing complex binding [GO:0044877]","protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]","Rab GTPase binding [GO:0017137]","Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor binding [GO:0051022]","thioesterase binding [GO:0031996]"]}},"context":{}}

Integrin ITGAL/ITGB2 is a receptor for F11R (PubMed:11812992, PubMed:15528364). Integin ITGAL/ITGB2 is a receptor for the secreted form of ubiquitin-like protein ISG15; the interaction is mediated by ITGAL (PubMed:29100055). Involved in a variety of immune phenomena including leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction, cytotoxic T-cell mediated killing, and antibody dependent killing by granulocytes and monocytes. Contributes to natural killer cell cytotoxicity (PubMed:15356110). Involved in leukocyte adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes including T-cells and neutrophils (PubMed:11812992). Required for generation of common lymphoid progenitor cells in bone marrow, indicating a role in lymphopoiesis (By similarity). Integrin ITGAL/ITGB2 in association with ICAM3, contributes to apoptotic neutrophil phagocytosis by macrophages (PubMed:23775590). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P24063, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11812992, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15356110, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15528364, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23775590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29100055}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Calcium","Cell adhesion","Cell membrane","Direct protein sequencing","Disulfide bond","Glycoprotein","Host-virus interaction","Integrin","Magnesium","Membrane","Metal-binding","Phagocytosis","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Receptor","Reference proteome","Repeat","Signal","Transmembrane","Transmembrane helix"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16301335}; Single-pass type I membrane protein {ECO:0000255}.","domain":"DOMAIN 156..327;  /note=\"VWFA\";  /evidence=\"ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00219\"","geneNames":["ITGAL","CD11A"],"geneOntologyCellularComponent":["cell surface [GO:0009986]","extracellular exosome [GO:0070062]","integrin alphaL-beta2 complex [GO:0034687]","integrin complex [GO:0008305]","membrane [GO:0016020]","plasma membrane [GO:0005886]","specific granule membrane [GO:0035579]"],"geneOntologyBiologicalProcess":["cell adhesion [GO:0007155]","cell-cell adhesion [GO:0098609]","cell-matrix adhesion [GO:0007160]","extracellular matrix organization [GO:0030198]","heterophilic cell-cell adhesion via plasma membrane cell adhesion molecules [GO:0007157]","inflammatory response [GO:0006954]","integrin-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0007229]","leukocyte cell-cell adhesion [GO:0007159]","leukocyte migration [GO:0050900]","memory T cell extravasation [GO:0035683]","neutrophil degranulation [GO:0043312]","phagocytosis [GO:0006909]","receptor clustering [GO:0043113]","regulation of immune response [GO:0050776]","signal transduction [GO:0007165]","T cell activation via T cell receptor contact with antigen bound to MHC molecule on antigen presenting cell [GO:0002291]"],"geneOntologyMolecularFunction":["cell adhesion molecule binding [GO:0050839]","ICAM-3 receptor activity [GO:0030369]","metal ion binding [GO:0046872]","protein-containing complex binding [GO:0044877]"]}},"context":{}}

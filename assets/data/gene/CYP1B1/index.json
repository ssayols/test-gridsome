Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:20972997, PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:10681376, PubMed:15258110). Exhibits catalytic activity for the formation of hydroxyestrogens from estrone (E1) and 17beta-estradiol (E2), namely 2- and 4-hydroxy E1 and E2. Displays a predominant hydroxylase activity toward E2 at the C-4 position (PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317). Metabolizes testosterone and progesterone to B or D ring hydroxylated metabolites (PubMed:10426814). May act as a major enzyme for all-trans retinoic acid biosynthesis in extrahepatic tissues. Catalyzes two successive oxidative transformation of all-trans retinol to all-trans retinal and then to the active form all-trans retinoic acid (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:15258110). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of certain PUFA. Converts arachidonic acid toward epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EpETrE) regioisomers, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15- EpETrE, that function as lipid mediators in the vascular system (PubMed:20972997). Additionally, displays dehydratase activity toward oxygenated eicosanoids hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoates (HpETEs). This activity is independent of cytochrome P450 reductase, NADPH, and O2 (PubMed:21068195). Also involved in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics, particularly converting polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aryl amines procarcinogens to DNA-damaging products (PubMed:10426814). Plays an important role in retinal vascular development. Under hyperoxic O2 conditions, promotes retinal angiogenesis and capillary morphogenesis, likely by metabolizing the oxygenated products generated during the oxidative stress. Also, contributes to oxidative homeostasis and ultrastructural organization and function of trabecular meshwork tissue through modulation of POSTN expression (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q64429, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10426814, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10681376, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11555828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12865317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15258110, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20972997, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21068195}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Disease mutation","Endoplasmic reticulum","Fatty acid metabolism","Glaucoma","Heme","Iron","Lipid metabolism","Lyase","Membrane","Metal-binding","Microsome","Mitochondrion","Monooxygenase","Oxidoreductase","Peters anomaly","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Steroid metabolism"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum membrane {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q64429}; Peripheral membrane protein {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q64429}.

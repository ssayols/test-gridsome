Requires the methyltransferase adapter protein TRM112 for full rRNA methyltransferase activity (PubMed:25851604). Involved in the pre-rRNA processing steps leading to small-subunit rRNA production independently of its RNA-modifying catalytic activity (PubMed:25851604). Important for biogenesis end export of the 40S ribosomal subunit independent on its methyltransferase activity (PubMed:24086612). Locus-specific steroid receptor coactivator. Potentiates transactivation by glucocorticoid (NR3C1), mineralocorticoid (NR3C2), androgen (AR) and progesterone (PGR) receptors (PubMed:24488492). Required for the maintenance of open chromatin at the TSC22D3/GILZ locus to facilitate NR3C1 loading on the response elements (PubMed:24488492). Required for maintenance of dimethylation on histone H3 'Lys-79' (H3K79me2), although direct histone methyltransferase activity is not observed in vitro (PubMed:24488492). {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24086612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24488492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25851604}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Chromatin regulator","Cytoplasm","Methyltransferase","Nucleus","Phosphoprotein","Reference proteome","Ribosome biogenesis","S-adenosyl-L-methionine","Transcription","Transcription regulation","Transferase","Ubl conjugation","Williams-Beuren syndrome","rRNA processing"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24086612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24488492}.

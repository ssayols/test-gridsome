Part of signaling pathways leading to the production of cytokines and interferon. Required for normal antibody isotype switching from IgM to IgG. Plays a role T-cell dependent immune responses. Plays a role in the regulation of antiviral responses. Is an essential constituent of several E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes. May have E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity and promote 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of target proteins. Inhibits activation of NF-kappa-B in response to LTBR stimulation. Inhibits TRAF2-mediated activation of NF-kappa-B. Down-regulates proteolytic processing of NFKB2, and thereby inhibits non-canonical activation of NF-kappa-B. Promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of MAP3K14. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15383523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17991829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19937093, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20097753, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20185819}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Alternative splicing","Apoptosis","Coiled coil","Cytoplasm","Disease mutation","Endosome","Immunity","Metal-binding","Mitochondrion","Phosphoprotein","Polymorphism","Reference proteome","Repeat","Transferase","Ubl conjugation","Ubl conjugation pathway","Zinc","Zinc-finger"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000305}.

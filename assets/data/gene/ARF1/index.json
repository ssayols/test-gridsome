Modulates vesicle budding and uncoating within the Golgi complex. Deactivation induces the redistribution of the entire Golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a crucial role in protein trafficking. In its GTP-bound form, its triggers the association with coat proteins with the Golgi membrane. The hydrolysis of ARF1-bound GTP, which is mediated by ARFGAPs proteins, is required for dissociation of coat proteins from Golgi membranes and vesicles. The GTP-bound form interacts with PICK1 to limit PICK1-mediated inhibition of Arp2/3 complex activity; the function is linked to AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking, regulation of synaptic plasicity of excitatory synapses and spine shrinkage during long-term depression (LTD).; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Functions as an allosteric activator of the cholera toxin catalytic subunit, an ADP-ribosyltransferase. {ECO:0000305}.","keywords":["3D-structure","Acetylation","Cell junction","Cytoplasm","Direct protein sequencing","Disease mutation","ER-Golgi transport","GTP-binding","Golgi apparatus","Lipoprotein","Membrane","Myristate","Nucleotide-binding","Protein transport","Reference proteome","Synapse","Synaptosome","Transport"],"subcellularLocation":"SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17555535}.
